<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Bibliophile, as he is somewhat pedantically termed,
probably dates his existence from the time when books began
to be multiplied in sufficient quantities to render the acquisition
of duplicate copies by the public a matter of possibility,
but his opportunities of amassing a large number of volumes
can hardly be said to have arisen until many years after the
invention of printing.</p>

<p>The most ancient manuscript extant has been identified
with the reign of Amenophis, who ruled in Egypt no less
than 1600 years before the Christian era, and this manuscript,
old as it is, shows such superior execution that there
can be little, if any, doubt that caligraphy in its oldest&mdash;that
is, its hieroglyphic&mdash;form must be referred for its origin to
a period still more remote. Diodorus Siculus relates that
Rameses II. founded a library in one of the chambers of the
Memnonium at Thebes, and deposited therein the 42 sacred
books of Thoth, which had they been in existence now would
be nearly 5000 years old. In those days, however, education
was looked upon as the peculiar property of the priesthood; the
library had sealed doors; even the very books themselves must
have been wholly unintelligible to all but the favoured few
whose duty it was to preserve them with religious care. All
the early Egyptian manuscripts extant have served in their day
an ecclesiastical rather than a secular object, and all of them
abound with mythological stories more or less recondite. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
use the art of writing for any less sacred purpose would have
been held disrespectful to the educated class and resented
accordingly. Ptolemy Sotor, who reigned over Egypt about
the year 280 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, appears to have been the first to break
through the artificial barrier which the priestcraft of age upon
age had succeeded in building up; and his magnificent twin
library at Alexandria, known as the Bruchium and Serapeum,
which was partly stocked with the confiscated books of
travellers who touched at the port, became in course of time
the most famous in the world, and would most probably have
been so at this day had it not been destroyed by Theodosius
and his army, as a sacrifice at the shrine of ignorance and
superstition. With the destruction of the library at Alexandria,
containing, as it did, books which can never be replaced, the
literary importance of the Egyptians came to an end; thenceforward
all that remained was the consciousness of having
instructed others better able to preserve their independence
than they were themselves. Yet after all it is somewhat
extraordinary that Egypt should have been not merely the
first to encourage a love of literature, but also the last; for
simultaneously with the destruction of the Bruchium and
Serapeum were ushered in the first centuries of the dark ages,
when the ability to read and write was looked upon as unworthy
the status of a free man, unless indeed he were a priest, and
when fire and sword were brought into requisition for the
purpose of annihilating everything that suggested mental
culture.</p>

<p>In the eras which intervened between the reign of Rameses
the Constructor and that of Theodosius the Destroyer, Pisistratus
had founded his public library at Athens, and collected
the poems of Homer which had previously been scattered
in detached portions throughout Greece; and Plato, the
prince of ancient book hunters, had given no less than 100
attic min&aelig;&mdash;nearly &pound;300 of our money&mdash;for three small
treatises of Philolaus the Pythagorean. Aristotle too, unless
he has been sadly maligned, thought 300 min&aelig; a fair exchange
for a little pile of books which had formerly belonged to
Speusippus, thereby setting an example to that French king of
after ages who pawned his gold and silver plate to obtain
means wherewith to purchase a coveted copy of Lacertius, as
Gabriel Naud&eacute; calls the great Epicurean biographer. In Rome
also Lucullus had furnished his house with books and thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
open his doors to all who wished to consult them. Atticus the
famous publisher had turned out a thousand copies of the
second book of Martial's <i>Epigrams</i>, with its 540 lines of verse,
bound and endorsed in the space of a single hour, and the
booksellers carried on a flourishing trade in their shops in the
Argeletum and the Vicus Sandalarius, exhibiting catalogues on
the side posts of their doors exactly as the second-hand
dealers in London and elsewhere do now. Of all this vast
enterprise of Greece and Rome not a trace remains: only the
sepulchral writings of mother Egypt and the clay tablets of
Assyria.</p>

<p>History tells us how the luxurious rich of Athens and Rome
regarded their books as so many pieces of furniture, and engaged
learned slaves to read aloud at their banquets; and if
the example of Plato were followed to any extent, doubtless large
sums of money were spent on rare originals which had passed
through the hands of a succession of dilettanti, and acquired
thereby a reputation for genuineness, which they could not
have gained in any other manner. Seneca indeed ridicules the
vulgar emulation which prompted some of his contemporaries
to collect volumes of which, he says, they knew nothing except
the outsides, many of them possibly barely that. It has been
ever so: in England to-day there are many who would have
felt the lash of Nero's tutor across their shoulders.</p>

<p>When the public no longer took pleasure in mental culture,
and the whole world was overrun with hordes of barbarians
intent upon destruction, learning of every kind was banished to
the monasteries, and the monks became the only book lovers,
making it their business to transcribe, generation after generation,
the volumes which had been saved from the general
conflagration. It is entirely through their efforts that the old
classics have been preserved to our day; we have to thank
them, and them alone, for the preservation of the Bible itself.
Even in the monasteries, however, the same spirit of emulation
which had prompted Greek to compete with Greek, and Roman
with Roman, became apparent in course of time. Ordinary
transcripts, though never numerous, began to be looked upon
as hardly pretentious enough, and the larger houses established
<i>scriptoria</i>, where trained monks sat the livelong day, painfully
tracing letter after letter on the purest vellum, while Bibliolatrists
added illuminated borders and miniatures in a style
that would task the skill of our best artists of to-day. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
competition led to the exchange of manuscripts, or to their
loan for a brief period, so that by degrees monastic libraries
assumed large proportions, numbering many hundreds of
neatly bound volumes, which, on being opened, looked as
though printed, so accurately and carefully had the copying
been done. This explains how Fust, the inventor, or one of
the inventors, of printing, was enabled to deceive the people of
Paris, for he flooded the market there with printed copies of
the Bible which he sold for 50 crowns each, instead of for 400
or 500 crowns, which would have been a fair price had they
been in manuscript. The book buyers of Paris <i>thought they
were in manuscript</i>, until the recurrence of one or two defective
types cast from the same matrix caused an inquiry. Fust was
arrested, not for the fraud but for witchcraft, and to save his life
he explained his process. Thus did the old order give place to
the new.</p>

<p>In a very few years after the discovery of Fust's secret the
whole of the western portion of Europe was dotted with printing
presses. Before 1499 there were 236 in operation; and six
years after Gutenberg had completed his Bible of 42 lines there
were no less than 50 German cities and towns in which presses
had been established. Considering that this only brings us
down to about the year 1462, it is evident with what rapidity
the art of printing was seized upon through the length and
breadth of the country of its probable origin.</p>

<p>In 1475 our own famous printer Caxton was being instructed
in the office of Colard Mansion at Bruges, and in 1477, if not
earlier,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he settled as a printer at Westminster, thus laying the
foundation of our English industry and establishing a native
press which has continued to grow year by year until it has
assumed its present enormous proportions. Authorities, however,
point out that improvement in the art of printing did not
come by age or experience, for, curiously enough, the science&mdash;for
such it really is&mdash;was almost perfect from its origin, and,
so far as this country is concerned, has distinctly deteriorated
since the death of Caxton and his pupils Wynkyn de Worde,
Faques, and Pynson. The typefounders of that early period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
were as expert as many at the present day and immeasurably
superior to most. The greatest care appears to have been
exercised in the casting, and competition did not engender
the slovenly haste which is only too apparent in many of
our modern publications. It is probable that, simultaneously
with the introduction of printing into England, a certain
limited few, most likely ecclesiastics and powerful nobles,
would commence to collect works from the press of Caxton,
and subsequently from the foreign presses. In 1545 the
Earl of Warwick's library consisted of 40 printed books, in
1691 that of the Rev. Richard Baxter of 1448. It is not until
a comparatively modern period that any single man has been
able to mass together thousands of volumes during the course
of a single lifetime, for it is only recently that printing has been
used on every trivial occasion, and in the manufacture of books
which would originally have been deemed unworthy of the
application of the art.</p>

<p>At the present day books constitute one of the necessities
of life and private libraries one of its luxuries. The collector
has such ample scope for the exercise of his favourite pursuit
that it has long since become a question not so much of
accumulating a large number of miscellaneous volumes, as of
exercising a rigid discrimination and confining one's attention
to works of a certain class, to the almost entire exclusion of all
others. Thus, some book hunters collect first, or, at any rate,
early, editions of popular modern authors, such, for example, as
Dickens, Thackeray, and Lever; others collect old editions of
the Scriptures, a few, the expensive early printed volumes which
are every year becoming absorbed into the public libraries, and
consequently growing more scarce. A small number attempt
to form an extensive all-round library, but they rarely, if ever,
succeed, partly because life is too short for the purpose, and
money too limited in quantity. Occasionally a large collection
comes to the auctioneer's hammer, but in nearly every instance
it will be found that it represents the labours of several generations
of owners, each of whom has contributed the principal
publications of his day or taken advantage of any proffered
bargain which he may have happened to come across during
the course of his lifetime.</p>

<p>The book lover however is not content with mere acquisition,
he feels it his duty to know something of the inner
life, so to speak, of each volume on his shelf&mdash;something,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that is to say, beyond the outside lettering. He wishes to
know the chief incidents in the history of the person who wrote
it, under what circumstances it was written and why, how many
editions have been published, whether the particular copy is
perfect, how much it is worth from a pecuniary point of view,
and occasionally the nature of the contents. The word
"occasionally" may be considered by some as used in an
objectionable sense, implying in fact that book lovers are not
always in the habit of reading what they possess. Let the
collector of Bibles say whether he is in the habit of reading the
various editions which he has been at such pains to collect, and
it will then be time enough to inquire into the practices of
other collectors who, like himself, though in different departments,
may not consider themselves justified in spending the
amount of time necessary for careful and satisfactory study.
In truth, if all books were read, it is only reasonable to suppose
that all libraries would be small; and, as we know the
contrary to be the fact, we must acknowledge the truth of the
main proposition to a very large extent. The happiness of the
book lover, as we know him when in the plenitude of his glory,
consists by no means in reading, but in the contemplation of
his possessions from afar; an inane treatise on theology
becomes the object of his daily prayers when bound in
morocco and stamped with the Golden Fleece of Longepierre.</p>

<p>In this short dissertation we have but little to do with the
contents of any book. This knowledge can be acquired as
circumstances and opportunity offer; we deal rather with extraneous
details which are necessary to be known by everyone
who aspires to form a collection of books for himself and would
know something of the history of each.</p>

<p>Every bibliographer, and also every collector of any
eminence, has within reach certain books of reference which
experience has shown to be absolutely necessary. Chief among
these is Lowndes' <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i> of which two editions
have been issued. The first was published in 1834; the second
in seven parts from 1857-61, with an appendix volume in 1864,
having been re-issued from the stereotype plates without a date
in 1871. The latter may frequently be picked up at auction
sales for about 25s., but there is this peculiarity about the
work, that it really would not seem to be very material which
edition is purchased. The book is imperfect and full of
errors: it cannot be relied on, and the second edition, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was edited by the late Mr. H. G. Bohn, the eminent bookseller,
is as untrustworthy as the first edition. The original plan, which
has never been departed from, was to give the names of English
authors in alphabetical order, placing under each the title of the
works he wrote, with the date of each edition, number of volumes,
in many cases the collation, and finally the sums realised at
auction. Nothing fluctuates so greatly as auction values, and it
is not surprising, therefore, to find that not a single entry in
Lowndes under this head can be accepted at the present day.
Some of the variations between past and present prices are
ludicrous in the extreme, and there is no doubt that anyone
who attempted to obtain his knowledge of the value of books
from Lowndes' <i>Manual</i> would find himself in possession of a
mass of old-time information which would be rather a hindrance
to him than otherwise. The <i>Manual</i> is useful because it gives a
full and tolerably complete list of English authors, and collates
many of their works with considerable care; it is, moreover, the
authority quoted by cataloguers, and, being a copyright publication,
practically bars the way to any rival work on the same
subject. For these and other reasons it is indispensable.</p>

<p>To ascertain the value of a book is an exceedingly difficult
operation; in fact, there are many who assert that it is impossible
to do so. Booksellers' prices, as disclosed in their catalogues,
are not much to go by, for it is notorious that a West End
dealer will often charge more than one who is established
further East. Again, some London booksellers charge more or
less than provincial ones, according to circumstance and the
character of their customers. Until recently there were only two
ways of becoming an adept in this department, the first and
best by practical experience, a method which is not, of course,
available to any but dealers and their assistants; and the
second, by indexing retail catalogues and striking an average.
A third method, that of taking the average of auction sales,
was not available until recently, for it is too troublesome, for any
save those whose business it is, to attend sales by auction all
day long for nine months out of the twelve, in order to obtain
the necessary materials.</p>

<p>In 1886, I conceived the idea of fully reporting all sales of
any importance taking place either in London or the provinces,
and in December of that year the necessary arrangements were
completed, with the modification that for the present, at any rate,
no notice was to be taken of any book which did not realise at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
least 20s. by auction. This publication, the success of which
amply demonstrates the necessity for its existence, is named
<i>Book Prices Current</i>, and already five volumes are published,
and a sixth will be ready at the beginning of next year (1893).
As a book of this kind would be useless without a full index,
the greatest possible care has been taken to make it as complete
and as accurate as possible. From <i>Book Prices Current</i>
a very good idea of the average value of almost any book may
be obtained. Careful note of the way in which the particular
volume is bound must, of course, be taken, for this, as might be
expected, makes a great difference in the price.</p>

<p>The French are supposed to be much better bibliographers
than our own countrymen, and if the character of the authoritative
works published in either country is a criterion of national
merit there cannot be much, if any, doubt that this is so.
Lowndes' <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i> takes no notice of books
published abroad, and, as they are in the majority, it becomes
necessary to seek an additional guide. This is afforded by
Brunet's <i>Manuel du Libraire et de l'Amateur de Livres</i>, published
at Paris in 6 vols. from 1860-65, and usually found, with
the Appendix on <i>G&eacute;ographie</i>, 1870, and 2 vol. <i>Suppl&eacute;ment</i>,
1878-80. In its place it is a much better book than Lowndes',
but it is very expensive, frequently bringing as much as &pound;10
and &pound;12 by auction. Here again, however, the values are quite
unreliable, and, as in the case of Lowndes', there is no index of
subjects whatever. From the three works mentioned very much
may undoubtedly be learned about almost any book provided
the author's name be known; but as it frequently happened
that many authors chose, for reasons satisfactory to themselves,
to conceal their names altogether, or in the much commoner
instance of the name being forgotten by or unknown to the
searcher, an index of subjects becomes a necessity. This is
partly supplied by Watt's <i>Bibliotheca Britannica</i> in 4 vols. 4to,
1824, two volumes being devoted to authors and two to
subjects, there being also cross references from one to the
other. This inestimable work occupied the author the greater
portion of his life, and is a monument of industry and research.
The auction value amounts to &pound;3 within a fraction, this being
one of the few books which has a fixed market price all over
the kingdom. Good copies in handsome bindings frequently
occur, and are worth &pound;4 to &pound;5. The <i>English Catalogue</i>,
initiated by the late Mr. Sampson Low, is a periodical which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
makes its appearance annually, and, unlike all the other works
I have mentioned, is confined entirely to current literature.
The title of every work published during the year is given, with
the month in which it was issued, the price, and publisher's
name, the whole being arranged in one line under the name of
the author. At intervals, which do not appear to be strictly
defined, collective editions of these annual catalogues, arranged
in one alphabet, are published, as well as of the indexes of the
<i>titles</i> which are appended to each annual issue.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that a work of this kind must be of the greatest
utility, and as the <i>English Catalogue</i> is merely a continuation
of the <i>London Catalogue</i> and the <i>British Catalogue</i>, the former
of which commenced so far back as the year 1811, it will be
seen that a comprehensive view can be taken of the whole
range of English literature from that date to the present. The
<i>Catalogue</i> has not, however, always been so carefully prepared
as it is now, and consequently in the earlier days many publications
were omitted. When this is the case Lowndes and
Watt will be found of material assistance, the latter especially.
A complete set of these catalogues, unfortunately, is very
difficult to obtain, and as the earlier ones are not indispensable,
it may be perhaps advisable to forego them and to
commence in 1814. The volumes to be acquired therefore
would be <i>London Catalogue</i>, 1816-51; <i>English Catalogue</i>,
1835-63, 1863-71, 1872-80, 1881-89; with the accompanying
subject indexes to the <i>London Catalogue</i>, 1814-46; and to the
<i>English Catalogue</i>, 1835-55, 1856-75, 1874 (<i>sic</i>)-80. It will be
noticed that the dates sometimes overlap each over, but this
is an advantage rather than a drawback. Among the other
books frequently consulted by both dealers and amateurs are
Mr. Swan Sonnenschein's <i>The Best Books</i>; the <i>Reference Catalogue
of Current Literature</i>, and Halkett &amp; Laing's <i>Dictionary
of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Literature of Great Britain</i>,
in 4 vols. These are mentioned together because they are
essentially subject indexes and the best of their kind.</p>

<p>Sonnenschein's <i>The Best Books</i>, already in a second and
vastly improved edition, is a comparatively recent publication,
in which, under subjects arranged systematically, are placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the best current books, whether ancient or modern, on each
subject, with the prices, sizes, publisher's name and dates of
the first and last editions of each. There are about 50,000
works included, and they together give a very good idea of all
the material in the various departments of research which the
specialist is likely to have occasion to read or refer to. Old
books are included where they are of actual present-day value
to the student. The selection is not, of course, entirely made
by the author, as it is impossible for him to have read a
hundredth part of the books recommended; most probably the
list has been compiled from the works of specialists, the various
encyclop&aelig;dias, and so forth; but however this may be, it is a
very useful one in the hands of a person capable of discrimination
(towards which the numerous critical and bibliographical
notes and the system of asterisks are a great help), especially if
he live near one or other of the large libraries now springing up
in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>The <i>Reference Catalogue of Current Literature</i>, a cumbrous
and unwieldy tome, the last issue of which was out of print
within a couple of months of its publication, consists of a large
number of publishers' catalogues arranged in alphabetical order.
Each work mentioned is indexed, and this has been accomplished
so fully and accurately that almost any book to be
bought new in the market makes its appearance here.</p>

<p>Halkett &amp; Laing's <i>Dictionary</i> is, as the title implies, a
record of the anonymous and pseudonymous literature of
Great Britain. If an author wrote under an assumed name or
anonymously, his real name will be found here, together with a
short account of his publications. This work can hardly be
said to be indispensable, but it is, notwithstanding, exceedingly
useful, and well worth the three and a half guineas which will
have to be expended upon it.</p>

<p>Among other works which at one time were thought more
of than they are now is Quaritch's <i>Catalogue of Books</i>, in one
thick volume, 1880, and a supplement which is back-dated
1875-7. The chief value of this lay not only in the prices,
which were, as in every other bookseller's catalogue, appended
to the items, but in the extraordinary number of the entries,
which cover the whole range of British and foreign literature.
Even now the work is useful, but there is no doubt that it is
gradually decreasing in importance, owing to the high-class
works of reference which have lately made their appearance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
As to values, <i>Book Prices Current</i> gives them much more
satisfactorily than any bookseller can pretend or afford to do,
while most of the bibliographical notes and references are to be
found in one or other of the works I have mentioned.</p>

<p>The collector who, as yet, is not sufficiently advanced to
fully realise the difficulties he will have to surmount before he
can bring together a judicious assortment of books, will at any
rate begin to see that the knowledge requisite to enable him to
do so is of no mean order. The preliminaries will take him a
long time to master, and he will find that the expense is a factor
by no means to be despised. Even the books mentioned are
not all that he may have to procure, for if, after consideration,
he should decide to devote his attention exclusively to one
branch of Bibliography, there are other books of reference to be
purchased, and a special course of study must be entered upon
and carefully followed, if he would hope to be successful.
Thus, should he decide to make Dickens or Thackeray his one
author, as so many people are doing now, he will need a guide
to direct his course. Memory is so treacherous that he can
take nothing on trust, and time so short that he cannot afford
to journey two sides of the triangle when he might have taken
the third. These special works for special departments are set
out and enlarged upon in the following chapter, but before
referring to them it may not be superfluous to remind the reader
that a book of reference only possesses a relative value. It
is quite possible to have a whole library within reach and yet to
be ignorant of the proper method of using it. Some of our
best writers had no library worthy the name, but the few books
they had they knew&mdash;knew, that is to say, how to extract the information
they required, which book to consult, how it was
arranged, and what might be expected of it. Though a book
collector is not necessarily a book reader, he will have to be
absolute master of his works of reference, or he will find every
volume on his shelf a useless incumbrance. Where to possess
all the absolute facts is of importance, the newest works are,
generally speaking, most likely to be the best; but this is very
far from being applicable to a library in all its departments.
Yet even in the case of works of a general nature a careful and
economic selection may be made, so as to cover, in a small
compass, much valuable ground.<br /><br /></p>

<h3><br />THE FIRST ENGLISH AUCTION SALE&mdash;FASHION IN BOOK
COLLECTING&mdash;SPECIAL BOOKS OF REFERENCE RELATING TO
PARTICULAR BRANCHES OF BIBLIOGRAPHY.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE first sale of books by auction which is recorded as having
taken place in England was held in Warwick Lane exactly
213 years ago, and Dr. Lazarus Seaman, whose library was
dispersed on the occasion in question, appears to have confined
his attention strictly to Latin Bibles of the 16th century, the
cumbrous works of the Puritan divines, and the great editions
of the Fathers&mdash;huge folios thought so little of that, allowing
for the change in the value of money, they can now for the
most part be bought from the booksellers for less than they
could then at auction. The reason which prompted this old
collector to limit his purchases to works of a single class was
in all probability much the same as that which prevails under
similar circumstances at the present time, namely, a natural
desire for finality, the outcome of an experience which shows
plainly enough that in order to form a complete collection of
anything its scope must be reduced to the smallest possible
compass. As a matter of fact Dr. Seaman appears to have
embarked on a somewhat extensive undertaking, for in the
period mentioned by far the greater majority of works issued
from the press were of a religious nature. Still the incident
is valuable from an antiquarian point of view, as it forms a
good precedent for a large body of modern collectors who,
like Seaman, follow the prevailing fashion of the day. This
fashion on being analysed will be found to vary at different
periods and to be of longer or shorter duration according to a
variety of circumstances which appear to be entirely without
the range of argumentative discussion.</p>

<p>In the year 1699, for example, a book was published,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
entitled <i>Entretiens sur les Contes de F&eacute;es</i>, in which one of the
characters is described as saying, "For some time past you
know to what an extent the editions of the Elzevirs have been
in demand. The fancy for them has penetrated far and wide
to such an extent, indeed, that I know a man who starves
himself for the sake of accumulating as many of these books
as he can lay his hands on." In the chapter devoted to the
Elzevir press, these important publications are treated as fully
as space permits, so that at present it will be sufficient to say
that for nearly 200 years many generations of collectors have
made painstaking attempts to form a complete library of these
little books, which, after all, excel only in the quality of the
paper and the beauty of the type. For real scholarly merit
the editions of Gryphius or Estienne are much to be preferred,
but this makes no difference. The Elzevirs were fashionable,
much more so than they are now, and accordingly they were
valued. It is, moreover, quite possible that they may again
rise in popular favour, in which event those far-seeing individuals
who are even now imitating the example of the collector mentioned
in the <i>Entretiens</i> will reap a rich harvest in case they
choose to avail themselves of it. The great guide-book on the
productions of this famous press is that by Alphonse Willems,
entitled <i>Les Elzevier, Histoire et Annales Typographiques</i>, published
at Brussels in 1880, with the <i>Etudes sur la Bibliographie
Elzevirienne</i> of Dr. G. Berghman, a kind of supplement to it,
published at Stockholm in 1885.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Each publication is given in the order in which it was
issued, and what will be found especially useful is an appendix
containing a list of the spurious Elzevirs issued from the
Dutch presses and of the forgeries which have from time to
time been foisted on the confiding amateur. With the assistance
of this work, the Elzevir collector cannot go very far
wrong, though he will undoubtedly have much to learn from
his own practical experience. He will become more or less
perfect in his lesson in time, and may take comfort in the reflection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that nothing so quickly ensures perfection as a limited
series of bad mistakes. As examples of the Elzevir press are of
"right" and "wrong" editions, with and without red lines, and
are, moreover, usually measured in millimetres with the assistance
of a rule which the enthusiastic collector invariably carries
about with him wherever he goes, it is evident that there is much
to learn and a great deal to be carried in the memory before
the amateur can trust himself to become his own mentor.</p>

<p>Difficult as the subject of the Elzevir press is, that of the
Aldine press is more so. It was established much earlier&mdash;<i>viz.</i>,
about 1489&mdash;and examples are more numerous and altogether
more confusing. As a general rule they are also more expensive,
and none but rich collectors can afford to compete
for examples of the best class. Still, good specimens
may occasionally be got for reasonable sums; and as a guide
to the subject as a whole Renouard's <i>Annales de l'Imprimerie
des Alde</i> (1st ed., 2 vols., Paris, 1803; 2nd, 3 vols., <i>ib.</i>, 1825;
3rd, 1 vol., <i>ib.</i>, 1834) occupies a unique position. This
work is arranged on a similar plan to the <i>Elzevier</i> and is
quite as indispensable to the specialist. An ordinary copy
of the 2nd ed. will cost about 30s., but the more recent
edition can sometimes be got for considerably less.</p>

<p>Those fortunate persons who succeed in forming a good
library of early printed books usually consult Dibdin's <i>Bibliotheca
Spenceriana</i>, which professes to be nothing more than a
descriptive catalogue of books of the 15th century in the
incomparable collection of Earl Spencer. It is, however, full
of notes by one of the best of English bibliographers. The
British Museum <i>Catalogue of Early Printed Books in English</i>,
3 vols., 1884, which is carried down to 1640, and Maitland's
<i>Early Printed Books in Lambeth Library</i>, 1843, carried down
to 1600, are also frequently consulted. These works are of
course supplementary to Lowndes' <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i> and
Watt's <i>Bibliotheca Britannica</i>, which, as previously explained,
are on the shelves of every collector worthy the name, be he a
specialist or not. The department of early printed books may,
however, be left without further comment, as not one person
out of many thousands is able for obvious reasons to devote
his serious attention to it. Public libraries and similar institutions,
which may be said to have a continuing existence,
frequently contain a good show of works of this class, and, in
the opinion of many, are the only suitable repositories for them.</p>

<p>Privately printed books are those which are issued either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from a private press or for the benefit of private friends.
They are never published in the ordinary acceptation of that
term, and cannot be bought at first hand. A good collection
of these is of course difficult, though by no means impossible,
to acquire; and for the benefit of those who may wish to
devote themselves to this department&mdash;uninteresting as it
undoubtedly is&mdash;Martin's <i>Privately Printed Books</i> (1834, 2nd
ed., 1854), in 1 vol. 8vo, is readily available. Many of these
so-called "books" consist merely of single sheets of letterpress;
others, on the contrary, are more pretentious. In the former
case they are more correctly termed "broadsides"; and R.
Lemon's <i>Catalogue of the Collection of Broadsides, in the possession
of the Society of Antiquaries</i> (8vo, 1866), though by no
means a perfect book, is certainly the best that can be procured
for our purpose.</p>

<p>Early printed American books, or those which in any way
relate to the American Continent, provided only they were
published during the 16th or 17th centuries, have lately become
exceedingly scarce. In June, 1888, nine small quarto tracts,
bound in one volume, brought, &pound;66 by auction, a record
entirely surpassed by the preceding lot, which, consisting of
twelve similar tracts only, brought no less a sum than &pound;555.
These prices are of course highly exceptional; but so great is
the desire to obtain books of this class that the amounts in
question, exorbitant though they may appear to be, were perhaps
not excessive.</p>

<p>The amateur may in this instance follow the rule with
every confidence. Should he at any time see a work relating
to America, no matter where printed so long as it is dated
before the year 1700, he should on no account pass it by
without very careful consideration; and the same remark
applies, though to a less extent, to all books printed in
Scotland before that date. In both cases it is probable that
the specimen offered for sale will have a most unprepossessing
exterior, and in some instances the price asked may be small.
This frequently happens, since the more uneducated class of
dealers commence by valuing a book from its appearance, and
while a coloured plate or two would at once put them on the
<i>qui vive</i> there is generally nothing about books of this kind
which <i>looks</i> valuable. It is no disparagement to the trade as a
whole to say that some booksellers, particularly those who carry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
on business in small provincial towns, are absolutely ignorant
of anything more than the first principles of their trade, and
it is out of these that bargains are made. Henry Stevens'
<i>Catalogue of the American Books in the Library of the British
Museum</i> (1886, 8vo) is from the pen of a late famous bookseller
who made many "bargains" in his time and whose
profound knowledge of the insides as well as of the outsides
of his very valuable collection was in every way worthy of his
success.</p>

<p>Shakespearian collectors cannot do better than consult the
article "Shakespeare" in Lowndes' <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i>,
where every known edition, translation, and commentary
professes to be catalogued and also in many cases collated
and described. Some of Halliwell-Phillipps' works, though
not absolutely indispensable, are nevertheless exceedingly
useful.</p>

<p>Bible collectors do not as a rule notice editions later than
what is styled the "Vinegar" Bible, published in 1717. They
commence with Coverdale's issue of 1535, and proceed onward
in regular order, for the most part arranging their collection
not according to date but under the various "versions". This
subject is very extensive and exceedingly difficult to handle,
so much so that, without a competent guide, it will be found
impossible to make satisfactory progress. This is provided in
Cotton's <i>Editions of the Bible and Parts thereof in English</i>
(1821, 2nd ed., 1852), and J. R. Dore's <i>Old Bibles</i> (1876, 2nd
ed., 1888). Mr. Dore is probably the best living authority upon
English Bibles and Testaments, and his book is in itself amply
sufficient for the amateur. It is published by Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode
at 5s.</p>

<p>For works on botany consult Pritzel's <i>Thesaurus Literatur&aelig;
Botanic&aelig;</i> (Leipsic, 1847-51, 2nd ed., 1872-7, 4to); and for
books exclusively relating to tobacco, some of which are very
rare and valuable, W. Bragge's <i>Bibliotheca Nicotiana</i> (priv. prin.,
r. 8vo, 1880).</p>

<p>Angling and the whole of the literature devoted to it is
dealt with in Westwood's new <i>Bibliotheca Piscatoria</i> (1883),
and swimming in R. Thomas' <i>Bibliographical List of Works
on Swimming</i> (1868, 8vo).</p>

<p>The Greek and Latin Classics were at one time great
favourites with all classes of collectors, but of late they have
fallen considerably from their high estate. Many of the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
editions, being printed by famous houses, as the <i>editio princeps</i>
of Virgil's works was, which sold for &pound;590 at the Hopetoun
House dispersion, a few months ago, are still eagerly sought
after, but not <i>qu&acirc;</i> classics&mdash;merely as specimens of ancient
typography. Ordinary editions of Horace, Virgil, Sallust,
Plato, Livy, and the rest can be bought now for a fourth or
fifth part of the sum they would have cost thirty or forty years
ago, and, from all appearances, they are likely to decline still
further in the market. The great work on this subject is
Dibdin's <i>Rare and Valuable Editions of the Greek and Latin
Classics</i> (2 vols., 1827), which can sometimes be bought by
auction for as little as &pound;1.</p>

<p>Art books are so numerous, and so readily subdivided into
an infinite number of classes, that they are rarely, if ever,
collected as a whole. Amateurs invariably use the <i>Universal
Catalogue of Books on Art</i>, which was compiled by order of the
Lords of the Committee of the Council on Education, and
published between the years 1870-7 (in 3 vols. sm. 4to). It is
a work that would be exceedingly difficult to improve upon,
though as time goes on it will of course be necessary to add
to it.</p>

<p>Works on Shorthand are catalogued by J. W. Gibson
(Pitman &amp; Sons, 1887), on Magic and Witchcraft in Scribner's
<i>Bibliotheca Diabolica</i> (New York, 1874), while books on music
and all about them are noted in C. Engel's <i>Literature of National
Music</i> (1879, 8vo).</p>

<p>We now come to the point when a short description of the
more modern methods of book collecting becomes a matter of
necessity. For some years it has been the fashion to collect
not so much works of a certain class as of particular authors,
chiefly those which are embellished with plates. By common
consent first editions are, with a few exceptions, alone worthy
of note; and it is also an axiom that where a book was
originally published in parts, those parts must on no account
be bound up in volume form. If the collector should be so
ill advised as to bind the parts, notwithstanding the decrees of
fashion to the contrary, he may save his position no little by
binding in the title-pages and also the lists of advertisements,
but if he neglects to do this, then his case is hopeless. This is
an example of the ridiculous rules which have been laid down
by a generation of autocratic book lovers, not one of whom
could in all probability give a satisfactory reason for his <i>dicta</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
It is, however, the rule, and will have to be followed, since
great pecuniary loss is certain to follow the slightest infraction
of it. Although the amateur does not buy his books to sell
again, still I apprehend it is a satisfaction to know that, in case
he should ever be compelled, though against his will, to sell
them, he will be able to do so without losing by his bargain.
Original editions of Dickens' works find a ready market, at
ever-increasing prices; but in addition to his better-known
books, the very titles of which have now become household
words, there are others which are not so generally known, such,
for example, as the <i>Curious Dance</i>, the <i>Village Coquettes</i>
and many small pieces which are scattered about the pages of
the magazines, and are usually classed under the heading
<i>Dickensiana</i>. The same remarks, but even perhaps to a
still greater extent, apply to Thackeray and his works, for that
great author worked for many years before his genius became
recognised. The bibliographer who has smoothed the way
for the Dickens and Thackeray collector is Mr. C. P. Johnson,
in his <i>Hints to Collectors of Original Editions of the Works of
Charles Dickens</i> (1885), and his <i>Hints to Collectors of Original
Editions of the Works of W. M. Thackeray</i> (1885).</p>

<p>The same author's <i>Early Writings of William Makepeace
Thackeray</i> (1888) contains a list of all the pieces which can
now be identified, and of the places where they are to be found,
so as to put it readily in the power of the biographer, the collector,
and the student to refer to them if he will. The <i>Snob</i>,
<i>Gownsman</i>, <i>National Omnibus</i>, <i>National Standard</i>, <i>The Constitutional</i>,
and <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> all contain essays, articles, or
tales from his able pen, which, but for Mr. Johnson's patient
efforts, might have been lost in course of time, when the evidence
to identify them would have been wanting.</p>

<p>Bibliographies of the works of Carlyle, Swinburne, Ruskin,
and Tennyson, as well as those of Dickens and Thackeray,
have been compiled by R. H. Shepherd, and of the works of
Hazlitt, Leigh Hunt, and Lamb by Alexander Ireland.</p>

<p>That famous artist George Cruikshank illustrated a large
number of books, all of which are eagerly sought after by
certain bodies of collectors. As in the case of other illustrated
books, the value mainly depends upon the earliness of impression
of the plates, and the condition; and consequently original
editions are more highly esteemed than those which followed.
Some capacity for judging engravings is required of the amateur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
who makes this branch of the subject a speciality, but in other
respects he will find almost everything he is likely to require in
G. W. Reid's <i>Descriptive Catalogue of the Works of George
Cruikshank</i> (London, 1871, 8vo).</p>

<p>Bewick collectors have an infallible guide in the Rev. T.
Hugo's <i>Bewick Collector, a Descriptive Catalogue of the
Works of T. and J. Bewick</i> (published, with the supplement, in
2 vols., 1866-8, 8vo). It is related of this author that he once
found a battered and ragged specimen of a child's book got up
on strong-laid paper by the famous engraver. Only one or two
copies are known to exist, as Bewick found the enterprise too
expensive to pay, and accordingly discontinued it. The owner
of this treasure was an old woman, who had derived her infant
ideas of lions and tigers from its well-thumbed leaves, and who
refused to part with an old friend, though sorely and even
desperately pressed to do so.</p>

<p>How often is the enthusiastic book hunter thwarted when
his hopes are on the point of being realised; how often must
he succumb to what he may consider to be nothing better
than prejudice or obstinacy? This is a question which every
amateur learns in time to answer for himself.<br /><br /></p>

<h3><br />PAPER-MAKING&mdash;DIFFERENT SIZES OF PAPER&mdash;DIFFERENT SIZES
OF BOOKS&mdash;MEASUREMENTS WATER-MARKS&mdash;BOOKS TO
CONSULT.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE mould used by paper-makers is a kind of sieve of an
oblong shape, bottomed with the very finest wire strands, all of
which run horizontally from end to end. From top to bottom,
and about an inch apart, are placed "chain wires," and on the
right-hand side of the mould the wire water-mark, which,
together with the wire-marks, appears semi-transparent. The
reason of this is that both water-mark and wires are slightly
raised, and of course the pulp is thinner there than anywhere
else. Any ordinary sheet of paper held up to the light will
show this, and serve to extra illustrate the following diagram.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/025.png" width="500" height="247" alt="Paper-maker&#39;s Mould: Jug Water-mark." title="" />
<span class="caption">Paper-maker&#39;s Mould: Jug Water-mark.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Here CDEF is the mould which the workman drops into
a vat of pulp, the fine strands run from G to H all the way
down the mould, AA, &amp;c., are the chain wires, and B is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
water-mark, in this case a jug. The water in the pulp of
course runs through the sieve, leaving a layer of soft matter,
which after a while hardens into a sheet of paper. The water-mark
was at one time the trade mark of the maker, but subsequently
became merely a symbol denoting the size of the
sheet of paper before it was folded. The smallest sheet was
water-marked with a jug, as above, and termed "pot"; the
next had a cap and bells, hence our term "foolscap"; the
next a horn, hence "post". Others had a "crown," and so
on. At the present day all water-marks have once more
become trade symbols, and cannot be depended upon to
afford any evidence of size; but at one time&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, before the
year 1750&mdash;this was not so, and, therefore, these water-marks,
irrespective of their antiquarian value, serve a useful purpose&mdash;namely,
to point out in cases of doubt whether any given book
is an octavo, quarto, or folio, or a variation of any of these
sizes.</p>

<p>To refer once more to the diagram. Take a sheet of paper
supposed to have come from the mould and double it in half
at the line AX. The water-mark will in that event appear in
the centre of the half sheet, and the folded paper is of folio
size. Now fold the paper the contrary way, and the water-mark
will appear at the bottom, but cut in half; the paper thus
folded is quarto (4to). Now fold it the contrary way again,
and a section of the water-mark will appear at the top; the
paper thus folded is octavo (8vo). We can go on folding,
and in every subsequent case the watermark will appear at the
edges, while, as the paper gets smaller and smaller, the sizes
are styled 12mo, 16mo, 32mo, and so forth.</p>

<p>In the example given, a book made of the sheet of
paper in question would be a pot folio, pot 4to, pot 8vo,
and so on; but as larger-sized papers were used, another
book might be a post 8vo, or a crown 4to, &amp;c., according to
circumstances.</p>

<p>As stated, this is one way of finding out the size of an old
book; but there is another way&mdash;by means of the "signatures,"
which consist of small letters or figures at the foot of the page
of nearly every book. The leaves (not pages) must be counted
between signature and signature, and then if there are two
leaves the book is a folio, if four a 4to, if eight an 8vo, if
twelve a 12mo, if sixteen a 16mo, and if thirty-two a 32mo.
Take, as an example, this very book you hold in your hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and it will be found that there are eight leaves between
signature and signature; hence it is an 8vo, though a small
one, owing, of course, to the small size of the paper from which
it has been made, <i>viz.</i>, crown. Had it been a little smaller (still
preserving its oblong shape) it would have been a foolscap 8vo,
if somewhat larger a demy 8vo, if larger still a royal 8vo, and
largest of all imperial 8vo. The quartos and folios are governed
by identical rules, and hence in the trade the sizes of books are
very numerous.</p>

<p>Simple as this method of computation may appear, a great
deal of controversy has taken place on the subject&mdash;so much
so, indeed, that there are people to be found who stoutly
maintain, and adduce proof to show, that what looks like a 4to
is in reality an 8vo, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. It would be out of place to
enter into a discussion of this nature, and, therefore, I should
advise the young collector to count the leaves between signature
and signature, and to abide by the result, regardless of all the
learned arguments of specialists. If there are no signatures,
and the book is an old one, then study the position of the
water-mark.</p>

<p>As examples, it will be sufficient to note that the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> is folio, <i>Punch</i> is 4to, and the <i>Cornhill</i> and
nearly all the monthly magazines are large 8vos. There is a
large number of varieties of each size, but on the whole books
which approximate to the sizes of magazines are of the sizes
named. Occasionally in judging by the eye in this manner a
mistake may be made; but of one thing there is no doubt, that
a vast amount of argument would have to be expended upon
the subject before the judgment could be proved to be
wrong.</p>

<p>Paper-makers at one period made their sheets in frames of
a given size, so that it was a comparatively easy matter to
distinguish the size of a book at a glance. Now-a-days, however,
there appears to be but little uniformity in this respect,
and the difficulty is consequently considerably increased. The
following measurements will, however, be found approximately
correct, and they may be utilised in a practical manner by
taking a sheet of brown paper of the required size and folding
it as previously mentioned, thus forming crown 8vos, crown
4tos, elephant folios, &amp;c., at will. The practice is good, and it
will not need to be often repeated.

<p>The only paper used, as a general rule, for making up
into 8vo books is foolscap, post, crown, demy, royal, and
imperial; 4to books are made up of all the sizes; though
elephant and atlas are chiefly devoted to folios.</p>

<p>I now take leave of this branch of the subject, and return to
water-marks, which, as previously stated, were formerly used, as
they are now, for trade marks, and as trade marks only.</p>

<p>Before the year 1320, paper was very rarely used to write
upon, but still there are a few examples of it having been so
employed extant, the chief of which is an account-book
preserved at the Hague, commencing with the year 1301.
The water-mark on the paper of this book is a globe surmounted
by a cross, while on paper of a little later date the rude
representation of a jug frequently appears. The globe and the
jug are consequently the most ancient water-marks yet discovered,
and these became the principal marks on paper,
then exclusively manufactured in Holland and Belgium. The
"can and reaping hook" appeared a little later, so did the
"two cans," the "open hand," and the "half <i>fleur-de-lis</i>,"
all executed, as might be expected, in the rudest possible
manner.</p>

<p>The Holbein family at Ravensburg&mdash;a town famous to this
day for the manufacture of paper&mdash;used a "bull's head".
Fust and Sch&oelig;ffer (<i>circa</i> 1460) used a "clapper" or rattle,
which has a somewhat curious history. At Ravensburg there
was an hospital for lepers, and whenever any of the inmates had
occasion to leave the building he was strictly enjoined to
flourish a rattle with which he was provided, so that healthy
folk could get out of his way. Paper made at the town is
often found marked with the rattle, that having grown, by
reason of its frequent use, into an institution of the place.</p>

<p>The next marks in point of date are in all probability the
"unicorn," "anchor," and the "P" and "Y," the initials of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Philip of Burgundy and his wife Isabella, who were married in
1430.</p>

<p>The famous English printer Caxton (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1424-91)<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> used
the "bull's head" paper from Ravensburg, the "P" and "Y,"
the "open hand," and the "unicorn"; sometimes even the
"bunch of grapes," which came from Italy.</p>

<p>The first folio of Shakespeare's works (1623) has paper
marked with a "fool's cap" among other devices. The "post
horn," another favourite device, which has given the name
to a particular size of paper&mdash;namely, "post"&mdash;was first used
about the year 1670, when the General Post Office was established,
and it became the fashion for the postman to blow a
horn.</p>

<p>In modern times paper-marks have become so numerous
that it would be next to impossible to classify them; nor would
it be of much advantage to the book collector even if it could
be done. With old marks it is different, for <i>fac-simile</i> reprints
of scarce and ancient volumes are frequently detected by
looking at the water-mark on the paper. Of course, this also
may be imitated, but there is often considerable difficulty
in attaining the requisite degree of perfection; and, under any
circumstance, some little knowledge of the early history and
appearance of water-marks will be found useful as well as
interesting. The best books to consult on the subject are
Herring's <i>Paper and Papermaking</i> and Sotheby's <i>Principia
Typographica</i>, 1858, the latter of which is a masterpiece of
learning and constructive skill.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3><br />FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It is very improbable that Caxton was born in 1412, as nearly all his
biographers state, but about ten or twelve years later. Evidence of this
is contained in the records preserved at Mercers' Hall, Cheapside, London,
where his name is inscribed as having been apprenticed in the year 1438,
the age at which apprenticeship was entered upon being most commonly
between twelve and fourteen years.</p><br /></div>

<h3><br />THE COLOPHON&mdash;TITLE-PAGE&mdash;THE FIRST BOOK WITH A DATE&mdash;COLLATING&mdash;ROMAN
NOTATION&mdash;LATINISED NAMES OF
PLACES, WITH THEIR MODERN EQUIVALENTS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T must be borne in mind that the title-page of a book, though
constituting a very old method of showing at a glance the
nature of the contents, together with the place of publication
and frequently also the date, is by no means the earliest means
of attaining that object. The title-page, such as we see it, was
first adopted in England in 1490, the year before Caxton's death,
having been introduced on the Continent in 1470;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but previously&mdash;and,
indeed, for some years after that date&mdash;the
<i>Colophon</i> was in general use.</p>

<p>The term "Colophon" has its origin in the Greek proverb,
"to put the colophon to the matter," that is, the "finishing
stroke," and contains the place or year (or both), date of
publication, printer's name, and other particulars considered
necessary at the time for the identification of the volume.
It frequently commences somewhat after the following form:
<i>Explicit liber qui dicitur</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The colophon, moreover, is
always found on the last page, and sometimes takes the form of
an inverted pyramid. In the early days, when the printer was
not unfrequently author or translator as well, the completion
of a work upon which he had probably been engaged for many
months&mdash;or, perhaps, in some instances, years&mdash;was rightly regarded
as matter for much self-congratulation, as well as for
thanks to the Divine Power, by whose permission alone he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
been enabled to persevere. Hence the <i>Psalterium</i> of Fust
and Sch&oelig;ffer, a folio of 175 lines to the page, and remarkable
as being the first book in which large capital letters, printed in
colours, were employed, has for its colophon a very characteristic
inscription, which may be translated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This book of Psalms, decorated with antique initials and
sufficiently emphasised with rubricated letters, has been thus
made by the masterly invention of printing and also type-making,
without the writing of a pen, and is consummated to
the service of God through the industry of Johann Fust, citizen
of Mentz, and Peter Sch&oelig;ffer, of Gernsheim, in the year of our
Lord MCCCCLVII., on the eve of the Assumption".</p>

<p>This Psalter is also the first known book which bears any
date at all, and for that and other reasons is one of the most
highly prized of volumes.</p>

<p>From what has been said, the reader will no doubt clearly
understand that it does not follow that, because an old book is
minus a title-page, it is necessarily imperfect. He should turn
to the last leaf for the colophon; but should that be wanting
also, it is probable that the book is deficient, though even this
is not a conclusive test. In cases of doubt the volume must be
<i>collated</i>, that is, critically compared with some other specimen:
each leaf must be examined carefully, and notes made of any
differences that may appear during the course of the examination.
There is a business-like way and the reverse of tabulating
these notes, so much so that an adept can see at a glance
whether it has been performed by a competent man. The
following is the collation of a copy of the first edition of the
famous Genevan version of the Bible printed by Rowland Hall
in 1560, 4to: "Four prel. leaves. Text, Genesis to ii. Maccabees,
474 ll. folioed, N. T. 122 leaves, 'A Briefe Table' HH h
iii to LLl iii., 13 ll. followed by 1 p. 'The order of the yeres
from Paul's conversion,' &amp;c., rev. blank."</p>

<p>At first sight this may appear somewhat technical, but when
a few of these collations are compared with actual copies of the
works to which they refer, there will be no difficulty in understanding
all the rest. The above, for instance, would read,
when set out at full length, as follows: "There are four preliminary
leaves, and then follows the Bible text proper, which,
from Genesis to the 2nd of Maccabees, is on 474 numbered
leaves. The New Testament, which follows, has 122 leaves;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
then comes 'A Briefe Table,' extending from signature HH h
iii to LL l iii, and comprising 13 leaves, followed by one page,
'The order of the yeres from Paul's conversion,' &amp;c. The
reverse side of this page is blank." The words "page" and
"leaf" have distinct meanings, the latter, of course, containing
two of the former, unless, indeed, one side happens to be blank,
as in the above example. If both sides are blank, the description
would be simply "i 1 blank".</p>

<p>From 1457&mdash;the date of Fust and Sch&oelig;ffer's Psalter,
already described as being the first printed book disclosing on
its face the year of publication&mdash;until comparatively recent
times, it was customary to use Roman numerals on the
colophon or title-page, as the case might be. This system
of notation is so well understood, or can be so speedily
mastered from almost any arithmetical treatise, that it is hardly
worth while to enlarge upon it here. On some old books,
however, there is a dual form of the "D" representing 500,
which is sometimes the cause of considerable perplexity; e.g.,
MI&#x186;XL standing for the year 1540. In this example the I
is equivalent to D; in fact, it would appear as if the former
numeral were merely a mutilation of the latter. Again, the
form CI&#x186; is equivalent to M or 1000. A few instances will
make the distinction apparent:&mdash;</p>

<p>The only part of a title-page which gives any real difficulty
to a person who has a fair knowledge of the Latin language, in
which most of these old books were printed, is the name of
the place of publication, which, being in a Latinised form,
frequently bears but a slight resemblance to the modern
appellation. Dr. Cotton, many years ago now, collected a
large number of these Latin forms, partly from his own
reading and partly from the works of various bibliographers
who had chanced occasionally to mention them in their works,
and at the present day his collection stands unapproachable in
point of the number of entries, as well as in general accuracy.
The use of this compilation will be apparent to those who have
occasion to consult it even for the first time, while to advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
collectors, who are not satisfied with mere possession, it will be
found indispensable. The title-page of a book now before me
runs as follows: "<i>Kanuti Episcopi Vibergensis Quedam breves
exposit&otilde;s s legum et jurium c&otilde;cordantie et allegati&otilde;es circa leges
iucie</i>"; at the foot is "Ripis, M. Brand, MI&#x186;IIII". The
question immediately arises: Where is Ripis, the place where
the book was evidently printed by Brand? The best gazetteer
may be consulted in vain, for the title is obsolete now; it is, in
fact, the Roman name for Riben, a small place in Denmark.
In like manner, Firenze frequently stands for Florence, Brixia
for Breschia, Aug. Trinob. (Augusta Trinobantum) for London,
Mutina for Modena, and so on. This being the case, some
kind of tabulation becomes absolutely necessary, and the best
that occurs to my mind is to place the Latin titles of all the
chief centres of printing in alphabetical order, and append to
each the English equivalent. The date is that of the first book
known to have been printed at the particular town against
which it is set. As the list is not complete, and could not be
made so without the sacrifice of a great deal of space, the
reader is referred to Dr. Cotton's <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>
for any further information he may require. The omissions
will be found, however, to consist, for the most part, of unimportant
places, from many of which only some half-dozen books
or less are known to have been issued, so that the following list
will be found sufficient in the vast majority of cases:&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

COPIES.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE reasons which contribute to make up the pecuniary value
of a book depend on a variety of circumstances by no means
easy of explanation. It is a great mistake to suppose that
because a given work is scarce, in the sense of not often being
met with, it is necessarily valuable. It may certainly be so,
but, on the other hand, plenty of books which are acquired
with difficulty are hardly worth the paper they are printed
upon, perhaps because there is no demand for them, or
possibly because they are imperfect or mutilated.</p>

<p>One of the first lessons I learned when applying myself to
the study of old books was never, on any account or under any
circumstances, to have anything to do with imperfect copies,
and I have not so far had any occasion to regret my decision.
It is perfectly true that no perfect copies are known of some
works, such, for example, as the first or 1562-3 English edition
of Fox's <i>Book of Martyrs</i>; but books of this class will
either never be met with during a lifetime, or will form, if met
with, an obvious exception to the rule. Fragments of genuine
Caxtons, again, sometimes sell by auction for two or three
pounds a single leaf, and even a very imperfect copy of any
of his productions would be considered a good exchange for a
large cheque; but these are exceptions and nothing more&mdash;
exceptions, moreover, of such rare practical occurrence as to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
hardly worth noting. In the vast majority of instances, when
a book is mutilated it is ruined; even the loss of a single plate
out of many will often detract fifty per cent. or more from the
normal value, while if the book is "cut down" the position is
worse. This lesson as a rule is only learned by experience,
and many young collectors resolutely shut their eyes to the
most apparent of truisms, until such time as the consequences
are brought fairly home to them. It is exceedingly dangerous
to purchase imperfect or mutilated books, or to traffic in them at
all. This position will be enlarged upon during the progress
of the present chapter.</p>

<p>To return to the reasons which contribute to the value of
a book, it may be mentioned that "suppression" is one of the
chief. This is a natural reason; others are merely artificial,
which may be in full force to-day but non-existent to-morrow,
depending as they do upon mere caprice and the vagaries of
fashion: with these I have, in this volume at any rate, nothing
to do.</p>

<p>De Foe, in his <i>Essay on Projects</i>, observes: "I have heard
a bookseller in King James's time say that if he would have a
book sell, he would have it burned by the hands of the common
hangman," by which he presupposed the existence of some
little secret horde which should escape the general destruction,
and which would consequently rise to ten times its value
directly the persecution was diverted into other channels.
This is so, for where an edition has been suppressed, and most
of the copies destroyed, the remainder acquire an importance
which the whole issue would never have enjoyed had it been
left severely alone. The Inquisition has been the direct cause
of elevating hundreds of books to a position far above their
merit, and the same may be said of Henry VIII., who sent
Catholic as well as Protestant books wholesale to the flames;
of Mary, who condemned the latter; of Edward VI., who
acquiesced in the destruction of the former; and of Elizabeth
and the two succeeding sovereigns, who delighted in a holocaust
of political pamphlets and libels.</p>

<p>The Inquisition, with that brutal bigotry which characterised
most of its proceedings, almost entirely destroyed Grafton's
Paris Bible of 1538, with the result that the printing presses,
types, and workmen were brought to London, and the few
copies saved were completed here, to be sold on rare occasions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
at the present day for as much as &pound;160 apiece. There is
nothing in the Bible more than in any other; it is not particularly
well printed, but it has a history, just as the Scotch
Bassandyne Bible has, though in that case the persecution was
directed against persons who <i>declined</i> to have the book in their
houses, ready to be shown to the tax collector whenever he
chose to call. One Dr. James Drake, who in the year 1703
had the temerity to publish in London his <i>Historia Anglo-Scotica</i>,
which contained, as was alleged, many false and
injurious reflections upon the sovereignty and independence
of the Scottish nation, had the pleasure of hearing that his
work had been publicly burned at the Mercat Cross of
Edinburgh, a pleasure which was doubtless considerably
enhanced when another venture&mdash;the <i>Memorial</i>&mdash;shared the
same fate in London, two years later. Drake had the honour
of hearing himself censured from the throne, of being imprisoned,
and of having his books burned, distinctions which
some people sigh for in vain at the present day. As a consequence,
the <i>Historia</i> and the <i>Memorial</i> are both desirable
books, and Drake's name has been rescued from oblivion.</p>

<p>William Attwood's <i>Superiority and Direct Dominion of the
Imperial Crown of England over the Crown and Kingdom of
Scotland</i> (London, 4to, 1705) is another book of good pedigree
which would never have been worth the couple of guineas a
modern bookseller will ask for it, had it not been burned by
jealous Scotchmen immediately on its appearance.</p>

<p>The massacre of St. Bartholomew produced a large crop of
treatises, and any contemporary book on the Huguenot side
is worth preservation, for a general search was made throughout
France, and every work showing the slightest favour to the
Protestants was seized and destroyed. Among them was
Claude's <i>D&eacute;fense de la R&eacute;formation</i> (1683), which was burned
not only abroad, but in England as well, so great an ascendency
had the French Ambassador acquired over our Court.</p>

<p>Bishop Burnet's <i>Pastoral letter to the Clergy of his Diocese</i>
(1689) was condemned and burned for ascribing the title of
William III. to the Crown, to the right of conquest. The
<i>Emilie</i> and the <i>Contrat Social</i> of Jean Jacques Rousseau
shared the same fate, as did also <i>Les Histoires</i> of d'Aubign&eacute;
and Augustus de Thou.</p>

<p>Baxter's <i>Holy Commonwealth</i> went the way of all obnoxious
books, in 1688; the <i>Boocke of Sportes upon the Lord's Day</i>, in
1643; the Duke of Monmouth's proclamation declaring James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to be an usurper, in 1685; Claude's <i>Les Plaintes des Protestans</i>,
in 1686.</p>

<p>Harris' <i>Enquiry into the Causes of the Miscarriage of the
Scots Colony at Darien</i> (Glasgow, 1700); Bastwicke's <i>Elenchus
Religionis Papistic&aelig;</i> (1634); Blount's <i>King William and Queen
Mary, Conquerors</i>, &amp;c. (1692); the second volume of Wood's
<i>Athen&aelig; Oxoniensis</i> (1793); De Foe's <i>Shortest Way with the
Dissenters</i> (1702); Pocklington's <i>Sunday no Sabbath and
Altare Christianum</i> (1640); Sacheverel's <i>Two Sermons</i> (1710);
and Coward's <i>Second Thoughts concerning the Human Soul</i>
(1702), were all burned by the hangman, and copies destroyed
wherever found.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most extraordinary instance of a work being
destroyed for positively nothing at all is furnished by Cowell's
<i>Law Dictionary</i>, which was sent to the flames by order of King
James the First himself. This dictionary, and indeed every
one of the books mentioned as having been subjected to the
purification of fire, are now rare historical landmarks, and
consequently both extrinsically and intrinsically valuable.
Hence the reason of the high prices frequently demanded
for them and for other works of this class.</p>

<p>The remaining copies of editions which were suppressed by
their authors, or which have escaped accidental destruction, are
frequently of considerable value. In the former class, Rochester's
<i>Poems</i> and Mrs. Seymour's <i>Account of the Origin of the
Pickwick Papers</i> are prominent examples; in the latter, the
third folio edition of Shakespeare's Plays (1664), almost the
entire impression of which was destroyed in the Great Fire of
London. Dugdale's <i>Origines Juridiciales</i> (London, folio, 1666)
was also almost entirely destroyed at the same time. Books
coming under one or other of these classes are to be met with,
and the note-book should always be at hand, so that a memorandum
can be jotted down before the reference is lost. This
course is adopted by the most experienced bibliographers, as
well as by the amateur who wishes to become proficient in a
study which is pleasant and profitable when conscientiously
undertaken, but difficult and worse than useless to those who
will not take the trouble to learn the rudiments of their science.</p>

<p>Works of limited issue are sometimes, but not always,
nor indeed often, of especial value. It has been the practice
for some years among publishers to issue works on what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
is nothing more nor less than the old subscription plan;
but, unlike the hungry poets of old, who trudged the
streets taking the price of copies in advance, the publishers
keep faith with their subscribers. The edition is limited
to a given number of copies, after which the type is
distributed, and the plates&mdash;if the work is illustrated&mdash;broken
up. Many speculators in books have endeavoured
from time to time to "corner" editions so limited in
quantity, buying at the published price, and subsequently
selling again at an increased amount. In this way considerable
sums have been <i>lost</i>, for works published on this plan have a
decided tendency to fall in the market, and when this is the
case they seldom if ever recover their former position.
Hogarth's works, published in 1822, by Baldwin and Cradock,
is a very good example of this tendency. The work was
originally issued at &pound;50, and the impressions, taken from
Hogarth's original plates, restored, however, by Heath, are
consequently of full size. There is a secret pocket at the end
containing three suppressed and highly indecent plates, which
considerably add to the value. I myself have many a time seen
this large and sumptuous book knocked down in the auction
room at sums varying from &pound;3 to &pound;5, and once bought a good
copy by private contract for &pound;4 10s. Ottley's <i>Italian School of
Design</i> is another example. This work when on large paper,
with proof impressions of the 84 tinted fac-similes of original
drawings by Cimabue, Giotto, Guercino, and other famous
painters, is worth about &pound;3 by auction. The published price
in 1823 was no less than &pound;25 4s. The issue of each of these
works was limited, but neither have succeeded in retaining
its position in popular favour, and in all probability will decline
still further in the market as time goes on.</p>

<p>The lesson to be learned here is that such phrases as
"only 100 copies printed," or "issue strictly limited to 50
copies," frequently to be observed in publishers' and auctioneers'
catalogues, should be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>. The description
may be accurate, but it does not follow that the limitation
necessarily increases the value of the book. On the contrary,
it may be well imagined that the publisher hesitated to launch
the book entirely on its own merits, seeking rather the extraneous
inducement of a "limited number". The earlier
editions of Ruskin's works are an exception to the rule, for
that author's reputation is deservedly great, and he is, moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
master of his own books, which from choice he has, until
the last year or two, preferred to render difficult of access.</p>

<p>Volumes of transactions and proceedings of learned societies
usually have a market value, which fluctuates much less than
is usually the case. These being supplied to members only,
and rarely published for purposes of sale, may be said to be
both privately printed and limited in issue at the same time.
As a rule they increase proportionately in value as the series
becomes more complete, and a point once reached, they
generally maintain it. Hence works of this character are safe
investments&mdash;perhaps the safest of any.</p>

<p>The result of every investigation into the causes which
regulate the value of books has shown conclusively that
no publication is of great worth merely <i>because</i> it is scarce.
The scarcity is a secondary and not a primary cause. Highly
appreciated English publications of the sixteenth and two following
centuries may be counted by thousands; but the number
of inferior treatises, which have long ago sunk into eternal
oblivion, which never were of any value, and never will be, are
as the sand on the sea-shore.</p>

<p>However scarce and valuable a book may be, it must be
remembered that the element of perfection has yet to be taken
into account. It does not by any means follow that, because
a copy of one of Shakespeare's 4tos is worth &pound;300, another
copy of the same 4to edition will be of equal value. It may
be worth more or less, and here it is that the critical eye of the
<i>connoisseur</i> and dealer tells. Defects, such as a tear in the
cover or any of the leaves, stains, worm-holes, and the like,
detract from the value; if these are entirely absent, the value
may, on the contrary, be raised above the average. The fact
of a rare book being "uncut," and in the original sound binding,
clean, and free from blemishes, considerably add to its
value.</p>

<p>The first part of a book to get worn out is the binding, for
some one or more of its previous owners are almost certain to
have ill-treated it either by bending the covers until they crack, or
by leaving the work exposed to the rain and damp. When the
volume is coverless, and usually not before, it will have been re-bound,
and the binder will, in ninety-nine cases out of every hundred,
have trimmed the edges, that is to say, planed them smooth
with a machine he has for the purpose. Sometimes he will
have cut as much as half-an-inch from the top, and nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
as much from the other edges; on other occasions, he may
have been more merciful; but the result is the same, the book
is damaged beyond hope of redemption, and the only question
is as to the extent of the injury. The term "uncut," so often
seen in catalogues, is, therefore, a technical term, meaning that
the edges are left in the same condition as they were when the
book was originally issued. It does not mean that the leaves
are "not cut open," as so many people appear to think, but
simply that the binder, with a fine sense of what is due to a
volume of importance, has for once kept his shears in his
pocket. The value of a book which has been cut is reduced
to an extent proportionate to the quantum of injury inflicted:
from 50 to 75 per cent. is the usual reduction, but many works
are altogether destroyed. If a scarce book is sent to be re-bound,
the binder should have the clearest instructions, in
writing, that he is not to trim the edges. Should he do so,
notwithstanding the direction, a by no means impossible contingency,
he will do it at his own risk, and can be made to suffer
the consequences.</p>

<p>Imperfect volumes are always a source of great inconvenience
to the collector. First-class bookselling firms will not allow
an imperfect book to leave their hands without notice to the
purchaser, and, as a consequence, they charge a higher price
than would be the case if the latter exercised his own judgment.
There are mutual advantages to be gained in dealing
with first-class people, for, if a mistake is made on one side or
the other, there is usually no difficulty in rectifying it afterwards.
Fine old crusted book-worms of the John Hill
Burton type prefer, however, to exercise their own discretion in
these matters, looking upon that as no inconsiderable part of
the pleasure to be derived from the pursuit of their favourite
occupation. They do not care to pay for being taught, at least
not directly, and make it part of their business to find out
for themselves whether a copy offered for sale is perfect or
the reverse. As each page is usually numbered, there is no
difficulty in ascertaining whether any are missing; not so with
the plates, for, unless there is an index to these, the loss of one
or two may hardly be noticed until the book comes to be collated
with another copy known to be complete. This is a risk
which the book buyer has to run, though, as a matter of practice,
he protects himself when the purchase is an expensive one,
and the dealer a man of credit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
In buying books at a cheap rate, or, in other words, when
making a bargain either at a shop or an ordinary street-stall,
the purchaser will have to observe the maxim, "Caveat emptor,"
and it will probably not be until he arrives home with his treasure
under his arm that he will have the satisfaction of ascertaining
that his bargain is a real one, or the mortification of
adding another imperfect book to the long row already on his
shelf.</p>

<p>Imperfect books are frequently what is called "made up,"
that is, completed from other copies, themselves imperfect in
other respects. One complete book is worth more than two
incomplete ones, and many desirable specimens, in the public
libraries and elsewhere, are made up so well that it is frequently
impossible to detect the hand of the renovator.</p>

<p>So long as all the leaves of a made-up book are of the same
measurement, there would not seem to be much objection to
this practice, but there certainly is when the paper of the interpolated
leaves is different from the rest, or smaller in size,
which it will be if cut down by the binder. Great care must
be taken to see that neither of these defects is present, especially
when, from the value of a book offered for sale, it may have
been worth anyone's while to perfect it.</p>

<p>Another point to be observed in the purchase of very expensive
and valuable works is, that none of the leaves have
been fac-similed. These fac-similes are done by hand, and
frequently so well that they cannot be detected without the aid
of a strong glass. The late Henry Stevens tells a good story
of a customer of his&mdash;Mr. Lenox, of New York, the founder
of the Lenox Library, and a most indefatigable collector up
to the last hour of his life. "Mr. Lenox was," says Stevens,
"principled against raffles, wagers, lotteries, and games of
chance generally, but I once led him into a sort of bet in this
way, by which I won from him &pound;4. I had acquired a fair
copy of that gem of rare books, the quarto edition of <i>Hariot's
Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginea</i>
(London, Feb., 1588), wanting four leaves in the body of the
book. These I had very skilfully traced by Harris, transferred
to stone, printed off on old paper of a perfect match, the book
and these leaves sized and coloured alike, and bound in
morocco by Bedford. The volume was then sent to Mr.
Lenox to be examined by him <i>de visu</i>, the price to be &pound;25;
but, if he could detect the four fac-simile leaves, and would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
point them out to me without error, the price was to be reduced
to &pound;21. By the first post, after the book was received,
he remitted me the 20 guineas, with a list of the fac-similes,
but on my informing him that two of <i>his</i> fac-similes were
originals, he immediately remitted the four pounds, and acknowledged
his defeat."</p>

<p>This Harris, whose name is prominently mentioned, was
probably the greatest adept at this species of imitation who
ever lived, and many important but defective works, now in the
British Museum, left his hands, to all appearance, in first-rate
order and condition.</p>

<p>"Laying down" is a technical term used to express the
process of re-backing a torn plate or engraving. Many of the
Shakespeare folios have the portrait and verses by Ben Jonson
laid down or "re-laid," as the catalogues generally describe it.
This, of course, can be detected at a glance, and it may be
stated positively that a laid-down plate, frontispiece, or title is
looked upon as a serious blemish, inferior only to the entire
absence of one or more of the three.</p>

<p>Worm-holes, stains, fox-marks, and other flaws also detract
from value; but as many of these may be removed by a judicious
application of proper remedies, a special chapter will be
reserved for their consideration. The market value of a book is
thus composed of many elements, the chief of which is "condition"&mdash;above
all things, a broad margin, and next, to that,
leaves of spotless white.</p>

<p>I have already stated that where editions of the works of
famous modern authors containing plates were originally issued
in parts, such parts should, on no account, be bound up in
volume form. The result of such a course cannot be better
illustrated than by taking the well-known <i>Pickwick Papers</i>
as our example, and studying the following prices, all realised
at auction quite recently:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club</i>, original ed.,
with illustrations by Seymour &amp; Browne, and the Buss plates,
<i>complete in numbers</i>, 1837, 8vo, &pound;8 10s.; &pound;12 14s.; &pound;8 10s.;
&pound;6 5s.; &pound;11 5s.</p>

<p><i>Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club</i>, original ed.
(<i>bound</i>), with illustrations by Seymour &amp; Browne, and the Buss
plates, 1837, 8vo, &pound;1 (half calf), &pound;1 1s. (half calf), &pound;3 (calf
extra), &pound;2 12s. (half morocco extra), &pound;2 5s. (half calf extra),
&pound;1 7s. (half morocco extra), &pound;3 10s. (calf, gilt, an unusually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
clean copy, recently sold at the Mackenzie sale). The evidence
furnished by these quotations is conclusive, and illustrates
the principle better than anything else can do, that, in the
present state of the English book market, it is the height of
folly to bind up original parts of this nature. If, however,
it must be done, the depreciation in value may be reduced to a
minimum by binding in the best style, and taking care that not
only all the covers, but even the pages of advertisements, are
bound up also. On no account must the edges be cut, or in
any way tampered with, or the value will sink from pounds to
shillings on the instant.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this chapter by calling attention to the expression
"large paper," so often noticed. It has been the
practice for many years, on publishing certain classes of books,
to print off a limited number of copies on "large paper," or
paper of a larger size than that used for the ordinary copies.
Thus, the second edition of Bewick's <i>Birds</i>, in 2 vols., 1804,
is found in no less than three sizes, ordinary copies in demy
8vo, large paper copies in royal 8vo, and largest paper in imperial
8vo. The text is in each instance precisely the same,
but the books themselves are larger in size as we ascend the
scale. The well-known <i>Badminton Library</i> of sports and
pastimes is printed in two sizes, and as large paper copies are
invariably limited in number, their value is always greater than
that of their more humble brethren. Whether they maintain
their original published value is another question which can
only be solved by reference to particular cases as and when
they arise.<br /><br /></p>

<h3><br />THE RENOVATION OF BOOKS&mdash;DAMP&mdash;GREASE MARKS&mdash;SURFACE
STAINS&mdash;BOOK WORMS AND OTHER PESTS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE great enemy of books is unquestionably damp, which
corrodes the paper, covering it with reddish brown spots, or, in
extreme cases, patches. These unsightly marks, if once they
have taken a firm hold, cannot be removed, and the most that
can be hoped for is some preventive against an aggravation
of the evil. Damp, unlike mere surface stains, attacks the
tissue of the paper, rotting it completely through, and not
infrequently destroying it altogether. It is like a vital disease
which insinuates itself into the very seat of life, and, with
more or less despatch, consumes its victim.</p>

<p>Unslaked lime, as is well known, has a strong affinity for
moisture of every kind, and when there is plenty of this
substance about, damp is irresistibly attracted to it. Small
saucers full of lime should therefore be placed in close
proximity to valuable books, on the shelves if necessary, but
never in immediate contact with the books themselves, or the
remedy will be as bad as the disease to be guarded against.
The action of lime upon moisture has been very well known
for centuries, yet no one seems to have thought of applying it
to this useful purpose, and books have been doomed to slow
but sure destruction for the want of a precaution as simple as
it is obvious. Only the other day a correspondent, writing to
an American bibliographical journal, pointed out what he called
a new remedy against damp, which turned out to be based
upon nothing else than the well-known relationship which
exists between lime and water. If damp has only just commenced
its attack, the part affected should first be touched
with a wash of spirits of wine, and when dry with a very weak
solution of oxalic acid. If the "fox spots," as they are called,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
do not then disappear, the injury is permanent and no remedy
exists, as far as we at present know.</p>

<p>A really valuable book which stands in need of a thorough
cleaning should be placed in the hands of some competent
person, as considerable experience is necessary before even a
reasonable degree of success can be assured. If the marks to be
obliterated are numerous, the book had better be taken to
pieces by removing the cover and separating the leaves, first
cutting the binder's threads and taking especial care not to <i>tear</i>
anything. Each leaf must then be examined, both on the flat
and when held up to the light, for it is essential that the
particular description of dirt should be identified as closely as
possible.</p>

<p>If grease is apparent, it should first of all be removed, as
its presence will interfere with some of the subsequent processes.
With this object, the leaf must be laid perfectly flat on a sheet
of glass and the grease marks damped out with a pad of cotton
wool moistened with benzine. Rubbing is never resorted to;
the spots must be merely patted over and over again until
they disappear, which they will do after a time. Sometimes
the text itself will vanish as well, but whether it will do so or
not depends upon the character of the paper and the quality
of the printer's ink. If there is any danger, benzine should
not be used, as the whole sheet may be cleared of grease marks
almost equally well by covering it with a layer of chalk, placing
a piece of blotting paper on the top of it, and pressing with a
hot iron. Each leaf will, if necessary, have to be treated in the
same way, and it may occasionally be found necessary to work
on both sides of the paper.</p>

<p>When this process is complete, the next step is to give each
leaf a good general cleaning, and this may be done effectually
by placing it in a leaden trough and pouring upon it a shallow
surface of water. Two or three days of exposure to the rays
of the sun will bleach the paper perfectly white, and all kinds
of stains except fixed dyes will come out. The leaf is then
dried (not in the sun or it will turn yellow), and is ready for
the next process. It may happen that the sun is not available
for this, or, indeed, any other purpose, and when such is the
case, the surface dirt may be bleached off with a solution of
chloride of lime in the proportion of one part to forty of water.
The paper must be soaked in cold water before this mixture is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
poured on it, and both sides must be operated upon. This
solution being essentially weak&mdash;if it were otherwise it would
eat into the material&mdash;it is possible that it may be found
unequal to the task of removing some of the more obstinate
stains, which must therefore be touched with nitro-hydrochloric
acid. Finally, the leaf must be well washed in a stream of
running water, and allowed to dry naturally.</p>

<p>Another method of removing surface stains sometimes used
by restorers is to cover the paper with a thin layer of fine
powdered salt. Lemon juice is then squeezed on the surface
in sufficient quantities to dissolve the mineral, and the subject
finally washed in boiling water. The chief objection to this
process is the use of hot water, which, as may well be imagined,
is apt to pulp the paper, or in some cases even to efface the
printed text.</p>

<p>Stains which cannot be removed by these processes are of
several kinds. Lead pencil marks, for instance, will become
fixed if the paper is damped, and they should therefore be
helped out first of all with fine bread crumbs. Indian ink
stains give way before a camel's hair brush and a cup of hot
water, and all kinds of grease marks yield to benzine, turpentine,
or ammonia.</p>

<p>Lead stains can be got rid of by an application of peroxide
of hydrogen, or even hydrochloric acid; but the greatest care
will have to be exercised in handling the latter, or it will
corrode the paper in a very short time, causing it to crack and
break to pieces. If mixed with its own weight of water, and to
three parts of this compound one part of red oxide of lead is
added, its power for evil will be very materially diminished;
but even under these circumstances it is dangerous to use.</p>

<p>Each of these remedies has to be very carefully undertaken,
as the fatty matters in the printer's ink are exceedingly liable
to resolve, in which case the book will be spoiled. With care
and attention I doubt not that almost any book can be very
materially improved, if not made quite as good as new, by a
combination of the processes described; and the best plan is
to practise on some dirty and worthless specimen until the
requisite degree of proficiency is attained.</p>

<p>A "Literary Note" in the magazine entitled <i>Book Lore</i> for
July, 1887, observes as follows: "The renovation of books
is, of course, a work of art in itself, and so clever are experts in
the manipulation thereof, that many a dirty and decrepit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
volume has left their hands looking quite fresh and new. One
of the most difficult processes has hitherto been to take dirt
off the leaves without injuring the print. With this object
bread crumbs were at one time used; but modern science has
discovered three ways of effecting the same object in a much
more satisfactory manner. Oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric
acid, when in solution, will eliminate every trace of dirt
without in any way acting on the printer's ink. Writing ink
is not, however, proof against the attack of any one of the
three, and this, too, being considered for the most part as
'dirt,' comes out with the rest. If the leaf is afterwards
bleached with chloride of lime, the regenerating process is
complete. The remedy for oil stains, it may be observed, is
sulphuric ether. If the stains are extensive, it is best to roll
up each leaf and insert it into a wide-mouthed bottle half full
of ether, shaking it gently up and down for a minute or so.
On its removal the oil marks will be found to have disappeared,
and, as ether rapidly evaporates, a little cold water is all that is
afterwards required. Mineral naphtha and benzoline each
possess the property of dissolving oils fixed and volatile,
tallow, lard, wax, and other substances of this class."</p>

<p>Worm-holes, another source of disquietude to the collector,
are caused by grubs, which are popularly supposed to be the
larv&aelig; of beetles. They bore a circular hole through all the
leaves, utterly destroying the appearance of any volume upon
which they have fixed their attention.</p>

<p>The book worm has a pedigree in comparison with
which the family tree of a Howard or a Talbot is a wretched
weed. Lucian, in days remote, chides the voracious worm,
and other ancient authors have called attention to its ravages.
Another pest, called the "acarus," feeds on the paste and glue
in the binding; in fact, these two parasites between them will
very quickly digest the contents of an ordinary-sized book
unless steps are taken for their destruction. The late Sir
Thomas Phillipps, in a communication to the British Association
in 1837, observes: "My library being much infested with
insects, I have for some time turned my attention to the modes
of destroying them, in the course of which I observed that the
larva of certain kinds of beetles does not seek the paper for
food, nor the leather, but the paste. To prevent their attacks,
therefore, in future bound books the paste used should be
mixed up with a solution of corrosive sublimate, or, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
with any other poisonous ingredient. But to catch the perfect
insects themselves, I adopt the following plan: <i>Anobium striatum</i>
commonly deposits its ova in beech wood, and is more
partial, apparently, to that than any other wood. I have beech
planks cut, and smear them over, in summer, with pure fresh
paste (<i>i.e.</i>, not containing anything poisonous). I then place
them in different parts of the library where they are not likely
to be disturbed; the beetles flying about the room in summer
time readily discover these pieces of wood, and soon deposit
their eggs in them. In winter (chiefly) the larva is produced,
and about January, February, and March I discover what
pieces of wood contain any larv&aelig; by the sawdust lying under
the planks, or where it is thrown up in hillocks on the top of
them. All the wood which is attacked is then burnt for
firewood: by this simple method I have nearly extirpated
<i>Anobia</i> from my library."</p>

<p>To surprise and capture a book worm was at one time
looked upon as an impossible task; but lately a few successes
have been chronicled, but only a few. In order to ward off
their insidious attacks, many devices more or less satisfactory
have been proposed, but none appear to be absolutely preventative.
Dr. Hermann, a noted bibliophile of Strassburg,
after careful experiments, has come to the conclusion that a
combination of safeguards such as he suggests will have the
desired effect of putting to flight not only the worm itself but
all other enemies of the library, always excepting biblioklepts
and borrowers, against whom there is no defence. The combination
suggested by Dr. Hermann certainly seems sufficiently
powerful to resist almost any attack, in the same degree that a
huge man-of-war may be considered invulnerable when exposed
to the assaults of some cockle-shell of a boat. The only
objection is the immense amount of trouble and labour
involved in preparation, as will readily be perceived after a
perusal of the preventives, ten in number.</p>

<p>1. Abolish the use of any wood in the binding processes.
2. Recommend the bookbinder to use glue mixed with alum
in place of paste. 3. Brush all worm-eaten wood in the
repositories of books with oil or lac varnish. 4. Preserve books
bound in calf by brushing over with thin lac varnish. 5. No
book to lie flat. 6. Papers, letters, documents, &amp;c., may be
preserved in drawers without any danger provided the wafers
are cut out and that no paste, &amp;c., is between them. 7. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
bookbinder is not to use any woollen cloth, and to wax the
thread. 8. Air and dust the books often. 9. Use laths
separated one from the other one inch in place of shelves.
10. Brush over the insides of bookcases and the laths with lac
varnish.</p>

<p>Dr. Hermann cannot at any rate be charged with any such
sentimental regard for "vermin" as that which influenced Mr.
Day, a well-known book hunter of the earlier part of the
present century. One day, upon removing some books at the
chambers of Sir William Jones, a large spider dropped upon the
floor, upon which Sir William, with some warmth, said, "Kill
that spider, Day! Kill that spider!" "No," said Mr. Day,
with that coolness for which he was so conspicuous, "I will
not kill that spider, Jones; I do not know that I have a right
to do so. Suppose, when you are going in your carriage to
Westminster Hall, a superior being, who perhaps may have as
much power over you as you have over this insect, should say
to his companion, 'Kill that lawyer! Kill that lawyer!'
How should you like that? I am sure to most people a
lawyer is a more noxious insect than a spider."</p>

<p>The simplest protection yet discovered against book worms
is a liberal use of common snuff, which should be sprinkled all
over the shelves, the process being repeated every three or four
months. This is almost infallible, and probably quite as
effectual as Dr. Hermann's ten preventives rolled into one.
There is no magic in the art of preserving books&mdash;the great
art is to be able to get them, and to know what to buy and
how much to give for them. This acquired, the rest will come
easily enough. The contents of a whole treatise on the custody
and preservation of books might be very accurately and succinctly
summed up in a few lines. Keep out damp, let the shelves be
lined if possible with good leather, and last, but by no means
least, look at the insides of your books as well as at the
outsides.</p>

<p>Collectors of books are continually being asked to lend
volumes which happen to take the passing fancy of a friend or
even chance acquaintance, and it is frequently a matter of
some delicacy to refuse. Not one person in a hundred knows
how to treat a book properly, and the borrower is therefore
usually regarded as but one degree removed from an enemy.
Curiously enough, the famous bibliophile, Grolier, stamped his
books with a motto of invitation, "<i>Jo Grolierii et Amicorum</i>".
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
So did Charles de Savigny, who went to even greater lengths
still with his legend, "<i>Non mihi sed aliis</i>". The private history
of neither of these enthusiasts states how they fared, or how
many choice tomes were returned dog-eared and stained, even
if they were returned at all. For my part I possess no books
that I should fear to lend, as my whole library consists of
"working copies," useful, probably, but not valuable. The
amateur who is the proud owner of a single book out of the
common should hide it from the borrower even as from a
book worm. He may well lay the couplet which graced the
library doors of Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court to his heart:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<i>Tel est le triste sort de tout livre pr&ecirc;t&eacute;<br />
Souvent il est perdu, toujours il est g&acirc;t&eacute;</i>".<br />

<h3><br />THE ALDINE PRESS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE revival of classical literature in Europe is generally assigned
to the middle of the fifteenth century, and is, perhaps, coeval
with the invention of printing, when for the first time it became
possible to multiply books not only rapidly but without the
multitude of mistakes which invariably occurred in ordinary
manuscripts. We have seen that in the palmy days of Rome
some of the large publishing houses were quite capable of
turning out extensive editions at a few hours' notice. No
modern type-setter could possibly keep pace with one of the
trained slaves of Atticus, and when some hundreds of the latter
were assembled in a room transcribing the MS. of some favourite
author through the medium of a professional reader, many
copies would be completed in an incredibly short space of time.
If, however, the reader made a mistake, it would be faithfully
and universally reproduced, while in addition each transcriber
might fairly be credited with a number of errors of his own.
To this extent the printing press was a great improvement. If
it did its work more slowly, less workmen were required; and
though each movement of the machine would perpetuate the
same errors, these might be reduced to a minimum by the
very simple expedient of carefully reading and correcting the
"proofs".</p>

<p>The year 1450 ushered in, as is supposed, the great art
which was destined to revolutionise the world; and although
the pen was employed for many years after that, it gradually
gave place to its more convenient if less nimble rival, taking at
last a position more congenial to it. "The pen for the brain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the press for reproduction," became henceforth a motto which
had for its basis a new division of labour as convenient as it
was efficacious.</p>

<p>In the same year,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> at Sermonetta, a little Italian town,
Aldus Manutius, the great printer and editor, first saw the
light. The earlier portion of his life was devoted entirely
to scholastic duties and in preparing himself, by hard and
assiduous study of the Greek and Latin classics, for the
more important work of revising and printing the text. It
was not until 1490 that the preliminaries were complete, and
he found himself, with a little money and an immense stock
of knowledge, a comparative stranger at Venice, where
already 160 printers and publishers had been engaged for
some time in glutting the market with almost worthless
books. The old Greek manuscripts especially were a source
of inconceivable trouble and continual annoyance. They
were written for the most part in bastard characters, and
crowded with mistakes and omissions, the result of some
hundreds of years of repeated transcriptions. They were,
moreover, almost as difficult to procure as they were corrupt in
text. Nor was this the only difficulty that faced the intrepid
pioneer editor. Greek was a language but rarely used, having
given place to Latin in all but the most cultivated circles; the
demand for books in that character was accordingly limited,
while even at that early period competition was ruinous. To
say nothing of the army of printers at Venice, there was a large
number at Rome who more than supplied the Italian and
foreign markets, turning out books in such profusion that the
important and oldest printing house, that of Sweinheym &amp;
Pannartz, was compelled to petition the Pope to save themselves
from bankruptcy. In their petition they state that they
had printed no less than 12,475 separate volumes, a statement
most likely exaggerated, but none the less cogent evidence of
the fierce struggle which was being carried on when Aldus
determined to swell the ranks of the already crowded profession.</p>

<p>He was disgusted with the slipshod efforts of the ignorant
proprietors of these numerous printing shops, who were so
eager to forestall one another that they could not pay any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
attention to the quality of their work, even assuming they
had the aptitude for doing so. He took his stand upon
his accomplishments alone, apparently not doubting for
an instant that conscientious work, coupled with a
superior education, would in the long run repay him for
the years of anxious toil which he well knew would be his
lot.</p>

<p>The Greek types of Rome, Milan, and Florence, hitherto
in use, and all cut to a single pattern, were abominable, and
Aldus commenced by casting types of his own. A fount of
Roman and Italian letters consisted of only 24 capital and an
equal number of small letters&mdash;the J and U were the same as I
and V&mdash;but a complete collection of Greek types with all the
varied accents and double characters, with which the language
abounds, amounted to no less than 600. Many of these he
was compelled at the outstart to forego, and he set to work
upon his first book, the <i>Grammatica Gr&aelig;ca</i> of Lascaris, with barely
a tithe of that number. It was well that Aldus should commence
with this work, for it was the first which had been
printed in Greek, some eighteen years previously by Paravisinus,
of Milan, whose small and crabbed type presents a remarkable
contrast to that of Manutius. Closely following upon this
venture comes the <i>Editio Princeps</i> of Aristotle, which, in its 5 vols.
folio, is unquestionably the most splendid and lasting monument
of the Aldine press. It was issued, one volume at a time,
between the years 1495-8, and was sold by the editor and
publisher for a sum equivalent to about &pound;5 of our money.
Next comes the <i>Editio Princeps</i> of Aristophanes, also in folio,
and dated 1498, which, like all the other productions of this
press at that early date, was printed from large open types
with broad margins. The expense of production and consequent
cost of these sumptuous volumes were great, too great in
fact to command a speedy sale, and Aldus at last began to
realise that it was infinitely preferable to print and sell a large
number of works at a cheap price than a smaller number at a
high one. Accordingly he had a more minute fount of type
cast, and in April, 1501, published his famous <i>Virgil</i>, a small
book of 228 unpaged leaves, measuring not quite 8 inches
by 4. The text, so it is said, was modelled after the neat
handwriting of Petrarch, and became known throughout
Italy as the Aldino type, though in France it was called
<i>Italic</i>, the name it goes by to this day throughout Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
This book was sold for about 2s. of our money, and was
the first serious attempt ever made to produce cheap printed
classics.</p>

<p>No sooner was the success of this venture assured than an
unknown printer of Lyons took advantage of the opportunity
to issue a wretched reprint, alike in every detail except the
quality of the workmanship. Aldus' painstaking textual corrections
were slavishly copied: even his title-page was stolen, and
the whole immoral production foisted on the public as a
genuine example from Venice, and at a little more than half
the cost. Horace and Juvenal, Martial and Ovid, shared the
same fate as fast as they issued from the legitimate press;
the Lyonnese printer was as persevering as he had proved himself
unscrupulous, and kept good time with the movements of
Aldus. But the fame of the latter was proof against servile
imitations, his types alone being so extravagantly praised by his
admirers that there were some who seriously contended that
their beauty was owing to the silver of which they were made.
There is, indeed, no mistaking them, and the collector has
only to place an original side by side with one of the reprints
from Lyons, to fix the superiority distinctly and irrevocably
in his mind. Aldus during his life printed altogether 126
editions known to bibliographers, 78 of which are in quarto
or folio, and many in two or more volumes. Some of these
consist of choice copies printed on white linen paper, notably
the <i>Opera</i> of Ovid and Plutarch, and many more passed
through several editions during his lifetime and after his
death, which, to the great loss of the world of letters,
took place on the 6th February, 1515, when he was 65 years
of age.</p>

<p>The distinguishing mark of the Aldine press is the well-known
dolphin and anchor which first makes its appearance on
the edition of the <i>Terze Rime</i> of Dante of 1502, and with few
exceptions on all the books afterwards issued from the press.
The story is that Aldus was engaged in printing Columna's
<i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i>, which appeared in 1499 (a good
copy sold in February last for &pound;80), and which contained
numerous illustrations, most probably by Andrea Mantegna.
One of these represents a dolphin twining about an anchor, a
mark so pleasing to Aldus that he subsequently adopted it,
using it over his office door as well as on the title-pages of all
his books.</p>

<p>At the death of Aldus Manutius his son Paolo, or Paulus,
being only three years of age, went to reside with his maternal
uncle Andrea Torresano, himself a famous printer of Asola, who
subsequently, with his sons, carried on the Aldine press at Venice
for the benefit of the parties interested. From that date until
1524 most, if not all, of the books printed at the press bear the
imprint: "In &aelig;dibus Aldi et Andre&aelig; Asulani soceri," and though,
as usual, bearing the anchor, a fresh block had been cut which
slightly alters its appearance.</p>

<br /><br /></div>

<p>From the year 1524 to 1529, when Torresano died, an exact
copy of the <i>first</i> anchor was again employed and continued to
be so used until 1540, when Paulus Manutius, the son of
Aldus, took exclusive possession of his father's business. It
will be noted that during the three years following the death of
Torresano (1530-31-32) no books were issued from the press;
and when it recommenced operations in 1533, it was for the
benefit of Paulus Manutius and the representatives of Torresano
"In &aelig;dibus h&aelig;redum Aldi Manutii et Andre&aelig; Asulani
soceri". In 1540, as before stated, Paulus Manutius took
entire control of the business, and a third variation of the
anchor was introduced, the inscription on the title-pages being
"apud Aldi Filios".</p>

<p>With the death of Paulus, the glory of the Aldine press
departed. He, like his father, had patiently striven to infuse
neatness and accuracy into his work, and is said to have been
in every respect his equal.</p>

<p>Aldus, the son of Paulus, who is known among bibliographers
as "the younger," had not perhaps the same opportunities as
were afforded to his predecessors. The art of printing had
advanced universally, and there was not so much room for
improvement as there had been formerly. He printed in a
good, but by no means exceptional, style, from 1574 until the
time of his death in 1597, when the Aldine press ceased to exist.
During a period of 103 years some 823 books had been issued,
many of which are among the prizes of book collecting.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Aldus Junior, like his father and grandfather, used the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
anchor, but between the years 1575-81 it is so hidden in the
foliage of a magnificent coat-of-arms which had been granted to
the family by the Emperor Maximilian, that it is likely to be
overlooked by any who have not made the Aldine press their
special study.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The collector will need to be cautioned against accepting every
work bearing the anchor as a genuine example from the Aldine
press. Some are mere forgeries, but so badly executed as to
deceive nobody who has seen half-a-dozen of any of the
originals. Some printers assumed the mark by licence, as did
Torresano, who used Anchor No. 3, with the words "Ex Aldina
Bibliotheca," and occasionally Anchor No. 1, but, these exceptions
apart, it may usually be taken for granted that a book if
well printed and bearing the mark in question is authentic. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
any doubt exists it is easy to turn to the pages of Renouard,
where every genuine example is catalogued and described.
Some fifty years ago, Aldine collectors were more numerous
than they are now, and as a consequence prices were higher.
This particular branch of bibliography demands the sacrifice of
much time, and cannot be even approached without a fair
knowledge of Latin, Greek, and French. As a consequence,
the new school of collectors, whose knowledge of those languages
is not always as well grounded as it might be, have long since
severed their allegiance from old traditions and now confine
their attention to sober English, where, it must be admitted,
there is plenty of scope for good work.</p>

<p>Even yet, however, the earlier productions of the Aldine
press maintain their former position: perhaps they have even
surpassed it, for as specimens of ancient typography they stand
unrivalled. Reference is made chiefly to works dated before
1500, and to such exceptional specimens as the <i>Virgil</i> of 1501,
some of which are still worth more than their weight in gold.
The majority of works from this famous press have, however,
fallen enormously in value of late years, as witness the fine copy
of Augurellus, 1505, 8vo, beautifully bound in blue morocco,
which quite recently was sold by auction for less than a
sovereign: some few years ago it would have brought three
times the amount, and been considered cheap even then.</p>

<p>By way of illustration, I cannot do better than give a few
examples of modern prices, comparing them with the approximate
amounts which would have been obtained some
twenty-five or thirty years ago.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Homeri Opera</i>, 2 vols. 8vo, red morocco extra, gilt edges,
<i>Venetiis</i>, Aldus, 1524, &pound;3 15s. Would have sold for &pound;9
or &pound;10.</p>

<p><i>Silius Italicus de Bello Punico</i>, old Venetian binding, gold
tooling, lettered in gold, gilt edges, <i>Venetiis</i>, Aldus, 1523,
&pound;1 18s. Would have sold for about &pound;5.</p>

<p><i>Virgilius, cura Aldi Pii Manulii</i>, red morocco, gilt edges,
by Roger Payne, <i>Venetiis</i>, Aldus, 1514, &pound;4 5s. Sold in
1825 at from &pound;10 to &pound;12 in equally good binding.</p>

<p><i>Psalterium Gr&aelig;ce</i>, a fine copy, in blue morocco, with gilt
edges, <i>Venetiis</i>, Aldus, no date, but about 1498, &pound;12.
Notwithstanding the fact that this is one of the few
fifteenth century books from the Aldine press, its value
has declined about 25 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Quintiliani Institutiones</i>, fine copy in russia, gilt edges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<i>Venetiis</i>, Aldus, 1521, on title 1522, 14s. Former price
about &pound;4.</p>

<p><i>Aristophanis Com&oelig;di&aelig;</i>, first edition, fine copy in russia,
gilt edges, <i>Venetiis</i>, Aldus, 1498, a rare book, &pound;4.
Former price about &pound;15.</p>

<p><i>Thucydidis Historia</i>, first edition, and one of the few copies
printed on fine paper, old russia, gilt, <i>Venetiis</i>, Aldus,
1502, a very scarce book in this condition, &pound;2 14s.
Former price from &pound;12 to &pound;15.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above examples are taken from a single catalogue, and,
if occasion demanded, the list could be indefinitely increased.
They will, however, be sufficient to show that if the good old
days when Eliot's <i>Indian Bible</i> of 1661, now worth considerably
more than &pound;500, could have been got for thirty shillings
or less, are not likely to return, there is yet plenty of opportunity
for picking up rare books at a moderate price, and for
much less than would at one time have had to be paid for
them.</p>

<p>Who knows that the fashion will not change again some
day, and that the most coveted of all volumes will not be
choice examples from the Aldine press?<br /><br /></p>

<h3><br />THE ELZEVIR PRESS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F Aldine collectors were at one time numerous and enthusiastic,
amateurs who affected the Elzevir press, and were
never tired of extolling the excellence of the little books which
issued therefrom, were more so. Long before the death of the
last member of the great printing family, a whole mass of rules,
some of them arbitrary, others founded on subtle distinctions,
were already regarded as binding on the community of bibliomaniacs
which looked upon <i>L'Aimable M&egrave;re de J&eacute;sus</i> as their
pole-star, and <i>Le Pastissier Fran&ccedil;ois</i> as something to be seen
only on rare occasions, and to be touched, if touched at all,
with bated breath.</p>

<p>There is something harsh, comparatively speaking, about
Aldus and his works. He was the taciturn, frugal-living man
of letters, who for five years, as he himself confesses, never
spent a single peaceful hour save when he was asleep. His
very doors were barred with the inscription&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Whoever you are, Aldus entreats you to be brief. When you have
spoken, leave him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Compared with this grim old editor-printer of a bygone age,
the Elzevirs one and all were literary children, playing with
their master's text&mdash;children who never grew old, and whose
many liberties were not only endured, but excused out of
consideration for their engaging ways. They were pirates, too,
without exception, but they turned you out well. If they
mutilated your text, they at any rate supplied you with the
best of paper, ornaments and type; from their hands you
emerged a well-dressed gentleman, a little ignorant perhaps,
but decidedly aristocratic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>A short sketch of the history of the Elzevir family will be
found useful for reference:&mdash;</p>

<p>The founder of the family, Louis, was born at Louvain in
1540, and, curiously enough, as in the case of Aldus Manutius,
did not establish himself at the scene of his future labours
until he was forty years old. In 1580 he started as a bookbinder
and bookseller at the University city of Leyden, and at
first confined his attention entirely to retailing such works as
fell into his hands. Three years later, however, he set up a
press and printed his first book, the <i>Drusii Ebraicarum qu&aelig;stionum
ac responsionum</i>, 8vo, 1583, which, though desirable, is
not to be compared, either in intrinsic merit or in value, with
some of the latter productions of the press; in fact, what are
known as the "good dates" do not commence until the latter
portion of the year 1625. Louis died in 1617, and is remarkable
only as the founder of a famous family of printers; not
one of his 123 different books can be considered important
from a collector's point of view; and although a specialist
would no doubt endeavour to make his collection as complete
as possible, and with that object might be disposed to pay
more for these early examples than anyone else might think it
worth his while to pay, even he, if well advised, would draw the
line at anything like lavish expenditure. Louis left five sons,
whom, with a view to further development, it is necessary to
bear in mind&mdash;Matthieu, Louis, Gilles (Giles), Joost (Justus),
and Bonaventure. The last-named son&mdash;Bonaventure&mdash;commenced
business on his own account as a printer in 1608, and
on the death of his father in 1617 he took the management
of the Elzevir press. In 1626 he took into partnership
Abraham, a son of Matthieu, and the newly-constituted firm,
which continued to exist until 1652, are entitled to most of
the credit which attaches to the name of Elzevir.</p>

<p>Though the Greek and Hebrew works issued by this
firm are inferior to those of Aldus and the Estiennes,
their small editions of the Latin and French Classics in
12mo, 16mo, and 24mo cannot be surpassed for elegance
of design, neatness, clearness, and regularity of type, as
well as for the beauty of the paper which they used.
Mention may be made especially of the <i>Novum Testamentum
Gr&aelig;cum</i>, 1624 and 1633; the <i>Psalterium Davidis</i>,
1635 and 1653; the <i>Virgil</i> of 1636; and the <i>Comedi&aelig;</i> of
Terence, 1635; though the works which gave the press its chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
celebrity were the collection of French authors on History and
Politics, in 24mo, known as <i>Petites Republiques</i>, and the series
of Latin, French, and Italian Classics, in small 12mo.</p>

<p>It seems to be an almost universal belief that all the works
issued from the Elzevir press are small in bulk, and various
terms, more or less foolish, have been invented by careless or
incompetent persons to give expression to this idea. One of
them, and perhaps the most hideous of them all, is "dumpy
twelves". In the first place, works issued from the Elzevir press
in 12mo are perfectly symmetrical in shape, and not at all dumpy;
and, secondly, many books are in 4to, some even in folio, as,
for example, the <i>Acad&eacute;mie de l'Esp&eacute;e</i>, printed by Bonaventure
and Abraham in 1628. The amateur must avoid being misled
by the poetical effusions which from time to time make their
appearance, and which for the most part are written by persons
who know nothing whatever of the subject. To obtain a
rhyme for "Elzevir" is difficult, but it has been done at much
sacrifice of common-sense.</p>

<p>Jean, the son of Abraham above mentioned, was introduced
into the firm in 1647, five years before it came to an end
through the death of the two partners in 1652. On this latter
event taking place, he entered into partnership with Daniel,
the son of Bonaventure, but the firm was not very successful,
and was dissolved by mutual consent in 1655. Jean continued
to trade on his own account until 1661, when he died, and Daniel
joined Louis, the third of that name, and son of the second
Louis, who had been printing at Amsterdam since 1638.</p>

<p>From 1655 to 1666 Daniel and Louis printed a series of
Latin Classics in various sizes. Louis died in 1670, and Daniel
ten years later.</p>

<p>We now come to the closing years of the press, though
reference must be made <i>en passant</i> to Isaac, another son of
Matthieu, who established a press at Leyden in 1616, and continued
to print there until 1625. None of his editions, however,
attained any fame.</p>

<p>The last representatives of the Elzevir family were Peter,
the grandson of Joost, who, during the years 1667-75, printed
seven or eight volumes of little consequence, which were published
at Utrecht, and Abraham, the grandson of the first
Abraham, who, from 1681 to 1712, was University printer at
Leyden. As the family pedigree is considerably involved, or,
like most other pedigrees, appears to be so at first sight, I give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a chart for the convenience of the reader, with the dates during
which each member of the family flourished, omitting, however,
the names of many other members of the family, who do
not enter into the scope of the inquiry, and who were, in
fact, not printers at all.<br /></p>

<p><br />The number of works issued from the press of the Elzevirs,
whether at Leyden, Amsterdam, or Utrecht, numbers, according
to Willems, 1608 different publications, of which 1213 bear
the name or mark of the firm which issued them. Of these
latter, 968 are in Latin, 126 in French, and the remainder in
Greek, Flemish, German, Italian, and Hebrew. There is also
a single volume, printed in English, which seems to have
escaped the notice of bibliographers. It is entitled "<i>Confession</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<i>of Faith, and the Larger and Shorter Catechisme, &amp;c.</i>, Amsterdam,
printed by Luice Elsever, for Andrew Wilson, and are to be sold
at his shop in Edinburgh, 1649". It is usually stated in works
of reference that none of the Elzevir publications were printed
in English, but the above, if it is genuine, affords an exception.</p>

<p>As every amateur is aware, the Elzevirs frequently&mdash;but
not always&mdash;marked their title-pages with devices, of which
the most frequent were the Sphere, the Hermit, Minerva, and
the Eagle on a cippus (low column) holding in its claws a sheaf
of seven arrows. As each firm adopted or relinquished the
family marks to suit its convenience at the time, it becomes
necessary to tabulate them for the purpose of avoiding confusion.
The number in brackets gives the total number of books, not
including catalogues, produced by the firm to which it is
annexed.</p>

<p>[The total number of books produced by the whole family
during 129 years amounts to 1618 works.]</p>

<p>The above are the chief, but by no means the only, marks
used by the various members of the family. The few which
have not been noticed occur only at rare intervals, and are of
but little importance. One device, representing a bees' nest,
with a fox and the motto "Quaerendo," though frequently
ascribed to the Elzevirs, is in reality none of theirs, being the
mark of Abraham Wolfgang, a Dutch printer of considerable
repute.</p>

<p>The Elzevirs, as before stated, were pirates, who thought
nothing of reproducing the full title-page, with the original
publisher's name, and, when this is the case, it is often a
matter of very great difficulty to distinguish between the
original and the reprint. Again, when these printers did not
wish to put their name to any particular work, for fear of
embroiling themselves with the Government, they either
marked it with the Sphere or else adopted a pseudonym.
Thus Jean and Daniel frequently marked their title-pages "A
Leyde, chez Jean Sambix," the Amsterdam printers occasionally
adopted "Jacques le Jeune," while "Nic Schouter" was a
favourite fictitious name. These pseudonyms are, however,
much less numerous than was at one time supposed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
first reproduction of the <i>Provincial Letters</i>, by Louis and
Daniel Elzevir, of Amsterdam, bears on the title-page,
"A Cologne, ch&eacute;s Pierre de la Vall&eacute;e, 1657"; that of
1659, by Jean Elzevir, of Leyden, has "A Cologne, chez
Nicolas Schoute". A <i>Recueil de Diverses Pi&egrave;ces servant &agrave;
l'Histoire de Henry III.</i>, &amp;c., bears "A Cologne, chez Pierre
du Marteau"; <i>Les Imaginaires</i>, of the Sieur de Damvilliers,
in its two parts purports to be issued "A Li&eacute;ge, chez
Adolphe Beyers". <i>Il Divortio Celeste</i>, with other works of
Pallavicini, dates from Villafranca, while other undoubted
productions of the Elzevir press were ostensibly published
"A Mons, chez Gaspard Migeot; Londini, typis Du
Guardianis; Stampati in Cosmopoli," and so on, through
a list which, difficult enough to remember, is yet not very
extensive.</p>

<p>It will be readily seen that the knowledge requisite for a
collector to possess, if indeed he wishes to become a master of
his subject, is of no mean order, for not only must he have the
family pedigree at his fingers' ends, and be capable of detecting
a pseudonymous or pirated work, but he must also be in a
position to appreciate the "right dates," and to detect an improper
head or tail piece when he sees it. Some books which
pass as Elzevirs are in reality spurious, even though marked
with the "Sphere" or other device; others, though coming
from the press, are inferior editions, "not of the right date,"
as the specialist puts it.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful little books ever issued from the
Elzevir or any other press is the <i>C&aelig;sar</i> of 1635, which, on
referring to the table, we shall see must have been printed by
Bonaventure and Abraham at Leyden.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is in 12mo, and
there are no less than three editions, the first and second being
so much alike that no one could detect the difference without
the most careful of careful inspections. The "right" <i>C&aelig;sar</i> is
the first, and may be recognised from the Buffalo's Head on a
scroll at the head of the dedication. Pages 149, 335, and 475
are misprinted 153, 345, and 375 respectively in the first
edition, and there are 35 lines to the page. The second
edition, which has not, pecuniarily speaking, a tenth part of
the value, has 37 lines to the page, and the misprints are corrected.
Another fine work, the <i>Comedi&aelig;</i> of Terence, Leyden,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
1635, 12mo, passed through five editions, all of which are very
much alike. The first and "right" edition has, however, on
page 51, the word <i>laches</i> printed in red, while page 101 is improperly
numbered 69. In the second edition <i>laches</i> is in
black, in the fifth it changes to red again, so that the greatest
caution has to be exercised lest the first and fifth editions
should be confounded. The former is worth much more than
the latter, as the unfortunate purchaser will find to his cost
when he comes to sell again.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the "good dates" begin from 1625,
the year when Bonaventure and Abraham went into partnership
at Leyden, and any books dated from that year to
1655, when Jean and Daniel dissolved partnership, are
most likely to be of value, provided only the right
edition is forthcoming. Daniel was, however, by far the best
printer in the family, though some make an exception in favour
of Bonaventure and Abraham; and as he continued in business
at Amsterdam, either by himself or in conjunction with Louis
from 1655 to 1680, those dates must also be considered
"good". From the Amsterdam press, in 1655, issued that
prize of Elzevir collectors, the <i>Pastissier Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, and the
splendid <i>Virgil</i> of 1676 in <i>grand</i> as well as <i>petit format</i>, or as
we should say in English, on large and small paper. The
halcyon days of the press at Leyden date from 1625 to 1655;
those of the press at Amsterdam from 1655 to 1680.</p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible for anyone, be he dealer or
amateur, to carry in his head all these details and distinguishing
marks, and reference in cases of doubt will have to be made to
Willem's <i>Les Elzevier</i>, a work which has superseded all others
on the subject. With this book at hand it is difficult to go
wrong, as the minutest points of difference are chronicled with
great fidelity.</p>

<p>We will now take it for granted that the amateur is in full
possession of, or can obtain, all the information necessary to
enable him to distinguish between a right and a wrong date.
He has still, however, to bear in mind that even a right-dated
volume may be in such a wretched condition as to be hardly
worth purchasing. If he will take a walk down Holywell
Street he may frequently meet with genuine Elzevirs which the
dealers will be only too glad to dispose of for a shilling or two
each. The reason of this is that, not only are the works
offered for sale <i>not</i> "of the good date" (<i>i.e.</i>, inferior editions),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
but they are also, in the vast majority of instances, battered,
dirty, and, worse than all, "cropped," sometimes even to the
very headlines. For a dirty book there is some hope, since it
may be possible to clean it, but for a cropped specimen there
is none: like Lucifer, it has fallen from its high estate "never
to rise again".</p>

<p>As the measurement of these small books is always made in
millimetres, 25&middot;4 of which go to the inch, the enthusiastic collector
carries with him an ivory rule on which the French
measures are marked. The <i>Ovid</i> of 1629, 3 vols. 16mo, runs
to 127 millimetres; the <i>C&aelig;sar</i> of 1635 to 130 millimetres&mdash;anything
below 125 millimetres is hardly worth looking at;
the <i>Virgil</i> of 1676, if uncut, reaches as high as 148 millimetres,
or, if in <i>grand format</i>, even to 184 millimetres. A book of
high measurement, or entirely uncut, may be worth &pound;100 or
more, according to its quality; but if cropped below the fashionable
height it would not bring as many shillings. A copy of
<i>Le Pastissier Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, 128 millimetres high, was not long ago
offered at 1500 francs, or &pound;60; an entirely uncut copy brought
10,000 francs, or &pound;400; and yet between the two there could
not have been a greater difference in height than three, or at
the most four, millimetres. The truth is that Elzevirs are
measured with the same accuracy observable in the weighing
of precious stones, and the 25th part of an inch makes a wonderful
difference.</p>

<p>That book collectors sometimes go to extreme lengths cannot
be doubted by anyone who has spent much time in their
company; but the English bibliophiles are not to be compared
in this respect with their French brethren. The latter are <i>the</i>
collectors of Elzevirs, and will frequently spend enormous sums
on specimens which from their appearance and real practical
utility are worth hardly anything at all. What can be more
incorrect than the Leyden <i>Virgil</i> of 1636? It is literally
crammed with the most shameful errors, so much so that
Heyne says it is destitute of the slightest trace of any good
quality. Yet the famous Charles Nodier spent nearly all his
life searching for a genuine copy of the first edition, which,
when obtained, filled a place purposely left vacant for it. Up
to that time he had declined to "profane" his shelves with any
<i>Virgil</i> at all.</p>

<p>Thus much for the Elzevir press, which, like the Aldine, is
not regarded with the same favour by collectors as it formerly
was. Nevertheless there are many, particularly in France, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
yet make a speciality of these little books with "good dates,"
and it is, therefore, necessary to know something of them. Of
one thing the collector may be quite confident: he has here
plenty of material for the study of a lifetime, and, what is
greatly to the point, ample opportunity of accumulating a representative
series of examples of the press. Good Elzevirs,
though rare, are not hopelessly so; while bad ones are as
plentiful as blackberries. In this respect, at any rate, the
Elzevir collector has a great advantage over many of his
fellows, whose hunting-grounds are circumscribed, and who
frequently would give anything to obtain even a mutilated copy
from the press of their favourite printer.<br /><br /></p>

<h3><br />THE EARLY ENGLISH PRESSES.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the short time that intervened between the invention of
printing by means of movable type and the end of the fifteenth
century some 20,000 different works are known to have
been issued from the European press. Many copies of these
are doubtless hidden away in old lumber rooms, or in the
recesses of imperfectly catalogued libraries of obscure and
decaying towns. Some have altogether perished, leaving no
trace of their ephemeral existence; others are known by
name, but have themselves vanished as effectually as if they
had never existed. What, for instance, has become of the
fifteen books of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> which Caxton, in his
preface to the <i>Golden Legende</i>, says that he printed? Hitherto
no copy has been unearthed, nor any fragment of a copy.
Where is the <i>Lyfe of Robert Erle of Oxenford</i> mentioned in the
preface to the <i>Four Sons of Aymon</i>? What was the great
printer doing between the years 1486-8, during which time, so
far as can be discovered, he printed nothing? These and
many similar questions are important, as raising a very strong
probability that the bibliography of Caxton is very far from
being complete. The same remarks apply more or less to
nearly every other fifteenth century printer. There is a field
here which has never been fully explored, and which, in all
probability, never will be until some Augustus shall arise, and by
a wave of his hand throw open the dwellings, the libraries, and
even the outhouses of the world to his troop of eager agents.
In the meantime, a single discovery of a hitherto unknown book
of the fifteenth century acquires an importance proportionate
to the exceptional nature of the occurrence; and though the
book hunter never despairs, he knows only too well that such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
rarities fall only to fortunate mortals like the French bibliophile
Resbecq, whose extraordinary luck was proverbial, or to those
whose ignorance is so dense that they seem provided, as
compensation, with more than a fair share of attractive power.
It seems a pity that the unappreciative should often obtain
chances which are denied to those who could utilise them to
advantage, but it is often the case. The merest tyro sometimes
experiences a success which the experienced bibliophile sighs
for in vain.</p>

<p>Glowing as this picture appears, the collector must not run
away with the idea that all early printed books are valuable.
Some, even of the fifteenth century, are not worth an Englishman's
ransom by a long way. The question of value depends
mainly on the name of, and the degree of reputation acquired
by, the printer. Thus, books printed by Fust and Sch&oelig;ffer,
Gutenberg and Fust, Sweynham and Pannartz, and many others
of the oldest continental printers, are scarce and valuable in
the extreme; so are any books from the presses of the early
English printers. On the other hand, the Estienne, Giunta,
and Plantin presses are comparatively neglected. Here, again,
it is a question of reputation, only, in this case, the inquiry is
directed not to the book itself, but to the printer, a reversal of
the usual rule, and one that is productive of an extraordinary
result, namely, that trivial books are often the most valuable,
simply because they have not been worth keeping. Let no
one, then, look, in the first instance, to the character of an
early printed book, but let him rather study that of the craftsman,
keeping in mind the current of popular favour and the
direction in which it flows. If he does this, he will find that,
so far as this country is concerned, there is a scope amply
sufficient to satisfy the most earnest aspirations. The long
line of printers from Caxton, in 1477, to Day, in 1546, and, in
a lesser degree, those of the subsequent fifty years, discloses
names which are graven on the heart of the collector, who
often accounts himself fortunate if he can procure a single
specimen from the early English press. As the chance of his
doing so, though remote, is by no means impossible, seeing
that copies are frequently offered for sale while many others
must be hidden away, it is necessary that he should have
some ideas of his own. To let slip a chance which
fortune throws in his way, and which may never occur
again, would be productive of never-ending regret, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
as, with a little care and attention, there is no reason why such
a disaster should occur.</p>

<p>The subject of the early English press could not, of
course, be entered upon fully without occupying considerable
space, and I must content myself with such a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> as can
conveniently be compressed within the compass of a few
pages.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that many of these old English
printers were, like Aldus Manutius, editors as well. In the
early days labour was not divided as it is now, and it is well
known that Caxton, for example, not merely translated many of
his publications, but cast his own type and bound the sheets
when ready for publication. Each of these processes was
perfected in his own office, and so well that to this day his
handiwork is seldom surpassed. Improved apparatus cannot
always hold its own against manual dexterity&mdash;an observation
which becomes more than ever accentuated when we apply it to
the art of Typography, perfect in its results almost from infancy.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Caxton, as, indeed, many of the other printers whose
names are subsequently mentioned, used several devices, of
which, I think, it will be sufficient to give the chief. This
pioneer English printer learned his art during the years 1474-5
in the office of Colard Mansion at Bruges. Sometime about
the year 1477 he established himself as a printer at Westminster,
where he died in 1491. There are certain distinguishing
features by which any of Caxton's works may be
known, even if the colophon is lost or the book a mere
fragment. His type is <i>always</i> Gothic or old English; he
never used catchwords nor commas; and although works from
the press of Lettou and Machlinia of London (1480) are
exactly like Caxton's in these respects, the measurement of any
given space occupied by 20 or 22 lines, according to the
description of type used, varies considerably. Since 1819,
some twenty hitherto unknown works by Caxton have been
identified by the measurement test, for a full explanation of
which the collector is referred to Blades' <i>Life of Caxton</i>.</p>

<p>Among the works printed by this great master may be
mentioned the following, which have brought the prices affixed
at auction, within the last few years:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Game and Playe of Chesse</i>, small folio, 31st March,
1474, the first book of Caxton with a date, and a
perfect copy, but wanting the two blank leaves (10&#x215B; in.
&times; 7&#x215B;; in.), old calf, &pound;645.</p>

<p><i>Dictes and Sayinges of the Philosophers</i> (11&frac12; in. &times; 8 in.), 1477,
folio, morocco extra, perfect, &pound;650.</p>

<p><i>Higden's Discripcion of Britayne</i>, evidently made up from
two imperfect copies (11&frac12; in. &times; 8 in.), morocco extra,
1480, folio, &pound;195.</p>

<p><i>Chronicles of Englonde</i>, 1480, folio, wanted part of the index
and otherwise greatly imperfect, &pound;67; another copy
(9&frac12; in &times; 7 in.), perfect, &pound;470.</p>

<p><i>Higden's Polychronicon</i>, 1482, 4to, a very imperfect copy,
containing only 205 leaves, &pound;31.</p>

<p><i>Ryal Book, or Book for a King</i>, perfect, but several leaves
mended (11&#x215B;; in. &times; 8&#x215B;; in.), no date (1487?), folio,
&pound;365.</p>

<p><i>The Prouffitable Boke for Mannes Soule, called The Chastysing
of Goddes Children</i>, no date, folio, quite complete; and
another called <i>The Tretyse of the Love of Jhesu Christ by</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<i>Wynkyn de Worde</i>, 1493, folio, both in one volume,
&pound;305.</p>

<p><i>B&oelig;cius de Consolacione Philosophie</i>, in Latin and English, a
complete copy, several leaves stained (10&frac34; in. &times; 7&frac12; in.),
old calf, no date, folio, &pound;156.</p></blockquote>

<p>Contemporary with Caxton were the printers Lettou and
Machlinia, previously mentioned, who carried on business in
the city of London, where they established a press in 1480.
Machlinia had previously worked under Caxton. Their
productions are scarce, but not so much so as those of
Caxton. An inferior copy of their <i>Vieux Abrigement des
Statutes</i>, no date, but about 1481, folio, sold by auction in
August, 1887, for &pound;8 10s., and occasionally other and better
specimens may be picked up for two or three times that
amount.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />
In all probability this famous printer was one of Caxton's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
assistants or workmen, when the latter was living at Bruges,
but without doubt he was employed in his office at Westminster
until 1491, when he commenced business on his own
account, having in his possession a considerable quantity of
Caxton's type. Wynkyn de Worde, who was one of the
founders of the Stationers' Company, died in 1534, after having
printed no less than 410 books known to bibliographers, the
earliest of which bearing a date is the <i>Liber Festivalis</i>, 4to,
1493. The whole of these works, especially when in good
condition, are excessively scarce, and invariably bring high prices.
A wormed copy of the <i>Descrypcion of Englonde, Wales, and
Scotlonde</i> brought &pound;10 at the Gibson Craig sale in July, 1887,
and the <i>Vitas Patrum</i>, 1495, folio, &pound;71, at the Crawford sale in
the same month. Voragine's <i>Golden Legend</i>, printed by de Worde
in 1527, brought &pound;81 a short time ago; his <i>Higden's Polychronicon</i>,
1495, folio, wanting title, &pound;16 5s.; the <i>Nova Legenda
Anglie</i>, 1516, folio (wormed), &pound;28; and Dame Juliana Berner's
<i>Fysyhing with an Angle</i>, 1496, folio (frontispiece inlaid), &pound;120.</p>

<p><br />This early English printer was by birth a Norman, but
became naturalised in England by letters patent and was appointed
king's printer. He was the first to introduce the
Roman letter into this country, though this honour is by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
attributed to Wynkyn de Worde. The Italian penmen of the
fifteenth century furnished the model for the round character
which has been successively adopted in most of the typographical
foundries since the days of Pynson, and which
is known as the Roman character; and these penmen are
supposed to have imitated the writing of the Carlovingian
MSS. Thus the small alphabet used by our printers is a copy
of that adopted in the churches of France in the time of
Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Among Pynson's works may be mentioned the following.
The prices affixed have, as before, been realised at auction within
the last few years.</p>

<p><i>Jeronimi de Sancto Marcho Opusculum</i>, &amp;c., woodcut
signs of the Zodiac and Pynson's device on title, a fine
copy in morocco extra, bound by Bedford (1509), 4to,

<p>The periods of the birth and death of this ancient
typographical artist are entirely unknown. One of his books,
the <i>Missale Secundum vsvm Sarvm</i>, dates from Westminster,
the 20th December, 1498, and one or two others are dated
1520, so that it is safe to say that he flourished between those
dates. One of the most extraordinary books issued at this
early time is the <i>Shepherd's Calendar</i>, printed by Julian
Notary. It is full of quaint woodcuts, illustrative of religious
myths, which, considering the times, are excellently executed.
An edition of this calendar was also printed and
published by Richard Pynson. The total number of books

Fawkes is given as 1509, it is more than likely that the date
on the title-page (<i>Salus Corporis, Salus Anime</i>, folio, 1509) is
a misprint. The next in point of date is a book of <i>Hours</i>,
1521, and it is hardly likely that twelve years should
have elapsed without his printing anything. Still, time has
spared such a few of this printer's publications that it is quite
possible the date may be correct. Specimens from Fawkes'
press are excessively rare, none having been offered for sale, so
far as I am aware, for many years.<br />

<p><br />Our information about this printer is very meagre, so much
so that little seems to be known of him beyond the fact that
he was the first printer in the borough of Southwark. He
printed for John Reynes, a bookseller in St. Paul's Churchyard
in 1527; also for Laurence Andrewe, who carried on
business in Fleet Street about the same date. Anthony &agrave; Wood,
in his <i>History and Antiquities of Oxford</i>, says that Treveris printed
some of Whitinton's pieces there in 1527, but no evidence
of the fact appears to be forthcoming. The first book known
to have issued from his press is the <i>Disticha Moralia</i>, 4to,
1514, though some bibliographers deny that Treveris was the
printer. The whole number of his productions, inclusive of
the grammatical treatises of Whitinton, which, on the authority
of Wood and for purposes of convenience, are ascribed to him,
does not amount to 30. They are, as usual, very scarce.</p>

<p><br />This printer was one of the assistants of Wynkyn de
Worde, and a legatee under his will. He was also a stationer
and bookseller, dwelling at the Rose Garland in Fleet Street,
where he carried on business from about 1515 to the year
1547 or beginning of 1548. His productions are not only few
in number, but very rarely ever met with. He seems to have
been fond of small and fugitive pieces, of which, doubtless,
a large number have perished owing to the popularity which
formerly attended publications of this kind. The number of
his works catalogued by Ames amounts to 12. This printer
must not be confounded with William Copland (<i>post</i>), whose
productions are, comparatively speaking, common.<br /></p>

<p><br />According to Bale, this printer was a citizen of London,
and married the sister of Sir Thomas More. The date of his
birth is not known, but he died in 1536, leaving two sons, one
of whom, William, succeeded to his business. Ames mentions
31 works printed by John Rastell and 15 by William, and
among the former is the famous <i>Pastyme of People, or
Cronycles of Englond</i>, of which only three perfect copies are
known to exist. A fac-simile reprint was issued in 1811 by Dr.
Dibdin. An original copy of this work, which contains 18
woodcut full-length portraits of the kings, was, though imperfect,
sold at the Wimpole sale, in June, 1888, for as much
as &pound;79. A copy of the reprint is worth about 30s.<br /></p>

</div>

<p><br />Books printed by this workman, which are only 13 in
number, are seldom seen. Much&mdash;and probably it is no
exaggeration to say, most&mdash;of the work of the English
printers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries has been
destroyed, and it is probable that between the years 1521
and 1537, when John Skot, or Scott, as he sometimes spelled
his name, is known to have been working, a large number
of publications was issued from his press, of which not a
trace remains. There is a good copy of the diminutive
tract known as <i>The Rosary</i>, printed by Skot in 1537, in
the library of Earl Spencer at Althorpe.<br /></p>

</div>

<p><br />Robert Redman set up a printing press at the house
quitted by Pynson, just outside Temple Bar, and called the
George. He seems also to have adopted a colourable imitation
of his device, and altogether to have taken great advantage
of his opportunities to undermine the business of his rival.
In the 1525 edition of <i>Lyttleton's Tenures</i>, printed by Pynson,
the latter takes Redman roundly to task, and in an edition of
<i>Magna Charter</i>, dated 1527, a similar strain of abuse is
maintained. The first book known to have been printed by
Redman bears date 1523. He died somewhere about the
year 1540.</p>

<p><br />This prolific printer was in business, "in the felde besyde
Charynge Crosse," from 1527 to about 1542, but as the
greater number of his books were published without dates, it
is possible that he may have lived beyond the year given.
The number of his books catalogued amounts to 68, and they
consist chiefly of treatises on Astrology, Medicine, and, more
rarely, Poetry.<br />

<p><br />Towards the middle of the sixteenth century the popular
demand for biblical legends and treatises on scholastic divinity
began to decline, and a taste for classical literature to take its
place. The productions of Berthelet, which give evidence of
the improvement in this respect to no slight degree, are intrinsically
valuable, as well as unusually numerous. Berthelet died
about Christmas, 1555, as appears by an entry in the Stationers'
Hall books for 26th of January, 1555-6. The number of his
works, as catalogued, amounts to 190.</p>

<p><br />John Byddell first carried on business at the sign of "Our
Lady of Pity," and seems to have borrowed his device from
one of the earlier pages of Corio's <i>History of Milan</i>, 1505.
Subsequently he removed to the "Sun," in Fleet Street,
formerly occupied by Wynkyn de Worde. This printer died
somewhere about 1544, having published 29 volumes, according
to Ames, most of which are of a serious character.</p>

<p><br />Richard Grafton, the king's printer, was at one time a
citizen and grocer of London, and seems to have been brought
up as a merchant. He commenced business as a printer with
Edward Whitchurche in or about the year 1537, and from that
date to 1541 they continually printed in partnership. The
dissolution was probably due to the persecution to which they
were subjected on account of the Act of the Six Articles.
Whitchurche, whose device is given below, is said to have
married the widow of Archbishop Cranmer, and is known to
have been living in 1560. Grafton, who was continually in
difficulties, and on one occasion narrowly escaped with his life,
is supposed to have died about the year 1572.</p>

<p><br />William Myddylton, or Middleton, succeeded to the business
of Robert Redman, which he carried on at the sign of the
"George, next to St. Dunstan's Church, in Fleet Street".
This printer turned out some 30 different publications, known
to bibliographers. There is no doubt, however, that many
more must be lost, or remain undiscovered. Myddylton
probably died somewhere about the year 1550. Another
printer, by name Henry Middleton, flourished about the year
1579. His works are scarce, but not nearly so valuable as
those of William.</p>

<p><br />The king's printer, was in all probability a foreigner by
extraction, if not by birth. He commenced printing in 1542,
but a great portion of his time was spent in collecting materials
for an <i>Universal Cosmography of all Nations</i>, which, though
undigested at his death in 1573, laid the foundation for
Holinshed's <i>Chronicles</i>. His works are described as being 59
in number, and, as is always the case where any specimens
from the presses of early English printers are concerned, are
scarce and valuable. After the death of Reynold, his widow,
Joan, printed three books, which bear her name. The last of
these is dated in 1580, about which time, doubtless, the press
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Care must be taken that this printer is not confounded
with others of the same name, who, for the most part, carried
on business in France and Holland.<br />

</div>

<p><br />Next to Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde, this printer certainly
ranks the highest in the opinion of bibliographers.
Herbert says that Day first began printing a little above Holborn
Conduit, and about 1549 removed to Aldersgate. He kept also
at the same time several shops in different parts of the town,
where his books were sold. Day was the first printer who
used Saxon characters, and brought those of the Greek and
Italic to perfection. He died in 1584 after having followed
the business of a printer for nearly forty years.</p>

<p>The name of John Day will sometimes be found in conjunction
with that of William Seres, but rarely, if ever, after
1550. This William Seres was a printer, who, on dissolving
partnership with Day in 1550, carried on business by himself
for some twenty or twenty-five years in London.</p>

<p><br />Probably a son of Robert Copland, though the relationship
is very doubtful. It has been supposed that William was a
younger brother of Robert, and worked in the office of the
latter up to the time of his death, in the same manner as
Robert worked in the office of Wynkyn de Worde. It is evident
that both William and Robert used the same battered
types, which they set up with an equal amount of carelessness.
Notwithstanding the workmanship, however, these books
are valuable, and always command high prices. The first

<p>With the advent of the seventeenth century presses became
very numerous all over England. Christopher and Robert
Barker at London, and John Field at Cambridge, are perhaps
the best known printers of that era, but the importance and
value of their works depend upon circumstances, and cease
to exist as a matter of course. It is indeed from this point
that the study of English bibliography becomes more difficult
and confusing, and here precisely that the young collector is
apt to go astray.</p>

<p>The most famous English printer of modern times was
undoubtedly John Baskerville; in fact, he seems to have been
the only one possessed of exceptional merit. Everyone has
heard of Baskerville: he rises the one solitary genius out of the
multitude of labourers in the same field, and towers so high
above the rest as to eclipse them entirely. Baskerville started
as a printer in Birmingham in 1756, having spent hundreds of
pounds in the experimental casting of type, which he ultimately
brought to the highest state of perfection. Every book printed
by him is a masterpiece: his paper is clear and elegant and of a
very fine quality, while the uniformity of colour throughout
testifies to the care taken in printing every sheet. At one time
works from the Birmingham press, presided over by Baskerville,
were much sought after, but of late years the fashion has
changed and prices have consequently much diminished. The
splendid edition of Addison's works, 4 vols., 4to, with portraits
and plates, 1761, a beautiful copy bound by Derome in red
morocco, brought &pound;10 a short time ago, a depreciation of at
least a third in the value, while in some other instances the fall
is much more marked. Baskerville appears at one time to have
studied the workmanship of the Elzevirs, and on one or two of
his books, notably the <i>Eleganti&aelig; Latini Sermonis</i> of Meursius,
1757, he has dated the title-page as from <i>Lugd. Bat. Typis
Elzevirianis</i>. This little volume is a fit tribute to a family
of famous printers of the seventeenth century, from a no
less excellent workman of the eighteenth, and I feel certain
that some day collectors will again vie with each other in
collecting choice examples from his press.<br /><br /></p>

<h3><br />ON BINDINGS OLD AND NEW.<br /><br /></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>OOKS cannot live long without being bound, and the more
expensive and artistic the appearance of the binding, the greater
the chance of preservation for the whole. A book is sometimes
handled gently, not because of any merits of its own, but
simply on account of its cover, which thus becomes its protector
in a double sense. Like those old earthen boxes, which on
being broken are found to contain the clay tablets of Assyria,
many of which run as far back as 1500 years before the
Christian era, bindings were doubtless originally intended to
act the part of preservatives; beauty of design and even
neatness would be after-considerations, and entirely subservient
to the sole object, that of protection. By degrees the book
lover made demands upon art, and, in obedience to an universal
law, the supply answered to his call. Cicero, we are told, was
a connoisseur of bindings, and himself employed famous workmen
to glorify his rolls of papyrus and vellum, or to bind up his
diptychs in the manner of our modern books, but more expensively,
if the tastes of the old Roman are not belied, than the
majority of book lovers can afford to do in these latter days.</p>

<p>In the palmy days of Rome, art in all its varied forms was
probably as advanced as it is now, and we cannot doubt that
Virgil and Homer, the representative poets of Rome and
Greece, were to be found in a score of palaces, dressed as
befitted their high reputation, in the most noble and expensive
of coverings. Two thousand years have, however, made a
clean sweep of Roman artist and Roman bookman alike, and
we have nothing to guide us beyond the casual remarks of one
or two diarists and historians of the day, whose chronicles
have happened, almost by chance, to come down to us.
The names of none of the ancient binders survive, and not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
trace of their workmanship remains; we know only that there
were such beings, who occasionally threw into their work great
taste and skill, and that bibliophiles vied with each other in
gaining possession of their choicest examples.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the question is asked, Who was the first
binder known to fame? we cannot look to Greece or to Rome
for an answer, nor yet to Italy. Curiously enough it is to
Ireland that we must turn, for there the monk Dag&aelig;us practised
the art so long ago as 520 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> One example only of his handiwork
has survived to our own day, and is now to be found in the
library of the British Museum along with the <i>Textus Sanctus
Cuthberti</i> bound by the first English workman, one Bilfred, a
monk of Durham, who flourished nearly 1200 years ago. This
<i>Textus</i>, so the old legend says, was once swallowed up by the
sea, which, respectful of the merits of the saint, gracefully retired
fully three miles of its own accord, and so restored the
cherished volume to its owners. As the monks were the sole
multipliers of books, so also they were, until the invention of
printing in 1450, the only binders. Manuscripts of the ninth
century are extant, heavily encased in ivory-carved covers or
confined between gold and silver plates studded with precious
stones. More often than not these expensive coverings were
destined to be their ruin, for, to say nothing of private peculation,
the sumptuous bindings were ripped off at the time of
the Reformation for the sake of the metal or stones, and the
manuscripts thrown in thousands upon the tender mercies of
the vandals into whose hands they fell.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century Petrarch was knocked down by
one of his own tomes, and was within an ace of breaking his
leg, but this was at a period when monastic bindings
ordinarily consisted of wood, covered with leather and protected
by metallic bosses, corner plates, and massive clasps of iron.
Bulk and weight were then the great desiderata, though every
now and then the richest materials were still employed in
binding, as when a king's library was added to, or some rich
monastery gave orders for a sacred volume to be covered with
the enamels of Limoges, ivory, gold or silver, and encrusted
with jewels.</p>

<p>From the end of the fifth to the middle of the fifteenth
century, books were excessively rare and costly, and comparatively
few bindings illustrative of the art during the dark ages
have been preserved. The few that have survived are wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
specimens of art, and in every way worthy of the illuminated
manuscripts they enclose.</p>

<p>The period of the Renaissance, which is usually assigned to
the Pontificate of Leo X., was witness of another change. The
ponderous tomes, whose weight was alone a protection,
gradually gave way to smaller-sized volumes, and these were
often bound in velvet or silk, beautifully embroidered by lady
amateurs, perhaps also by professed binders. At other times
the monastic covering of wood and leather is observable, and
often the leather gave way to seal and shark skin without any
tooling or other ornamentation.</p>

<p>These different styles of binding continued in vogue side by
side until the introduction of typography, when the Venetians
introduced morocco from the East and found out the virtues of
calf. Books now became bound in oak boards covered with
these leathers or in thick parchment or pig skin, old manuscripts
often being cut up and of course destroyed for the
purpose: boards, clasps, and bosses became obsolete, while
silken embroidery maintained a precarious existence, dependent
solely on the spasmodic efforts of accomplished amateurs whose
tastes and inclinations were swayed by fashion. Finally,
parchment disappeared and leather bindings held universal
sway, and have so maintained it to our own time, though the
English cloth-bound book is now employed whenever expense
is an object.</p>

<p>Such is a short history of the development of the art of
bookbinding, as necessary to be understood and remembered
as any other branch of our subject.</p>

<p>Some of the better-known and more valuable descriptions
of ornamental bindings, whether Italian, French, or English,
derive their entire importance by reason of their having come
from the libraries of noted collectors, who bound their books
after a model pattern. Many of these specimens are of the
greatest rarity and often of great value. As works of art, too,
they are frequently far superior to anything that can be,
or at any rate is, produced at the present day. A really
well bound book by Le Gascon, or one of the Eves, for
example, is a beautiful object. The covers, of the choicest
calf or morocco, are tooled in patterns, <i>i.e.</i>, hand engraved,
in gold; the edges are of gilt, <i>gauffr&eacute;</i>, that is to say, designs are
impressed on them also; the whole is a splendid specimen of
bibliopegistic skill. Such artists as these disdained blind
tooling, where the patterns are worked out and left without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
their meed of gold. Half-bound volumes with their back and
corners of leather and their sides of vulgar paper or boards
they were either ignorant of or despised.</p>

<p>All this excellence of course cost money, which then, as
now, was in the hands of the few, and it must not for a moment
be supposed that examples of high-class binding were at all
common even during the era in which they were produced.
They are scarcer now, for time and fire have claimed their share
of spoil, but it was only the great collectors of almost unlimited
means, popes, kings, and cardinals, and their favourites, who
could afford at any time to furnish a library where beautiful
bindings predominated.</p>

<p>These collections have for the most part been dispersed
over the world, and an amateur of the true old-fashioned type
will not allow himself to be looked upon as fortunate, if his
shelves do not contain one or two examples at least from the
magnificent libraries of brother amateurs long since passed
away.</p>

<p>The Italians were the first to awake to the enormity of
binding their books in pig skin, or encasing them between
clumsy wooden boards; and readily profiting by the teachings
of the great master painters, who made Italy their
peculiar home, they began to use calf and morocco, elaborately
tooled to geometrical patterns. Leo X. (1513-21) had a
good library, and one book at least is extant, bound by an
Italian artist in red morocco, with the Papal arms on the sides.
Some years previously to this, Aldus Manutius had bound his
own books at Venice, and he took as much care of their dress
as he did of the text. Some of these bindings appear to be
imitations of the designs sculptured on the walls of mosques,
and it was from the East therefore that the great Venetian
school obtained its first instruction in the art. The book
lover rejoices exceedingly when he meets with any of these
ancient Italian bindings, but if he can only possess a Maioli,
his cup of happiness literally overflows.</p>

<p>This Maioli&mdash;who or what he was are alike unknown&mdash;this
Maioli had an extensive library, and all his books were
sumptuously bound in the choicest leathers and tooled in gold
on the backs and sides. On an embossed shield was the title
of the work, and underneath, that inscription afterwards
imitated by Grolier, "Tho Maioli et Amicorum". Let not the
collector be deceived however:&mdash;there were two Maiolis:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Thomasso, above mentioned, whose choice bindings are sought
after all the world over, and Michel, whose artistic tastes were
less fully developed, and who perhaps knew better than to
invite his friends to borrow from his store.</p>

<p>Cardinal Bonelli (1541-98) and Canevari, the physician to
Pope Urban VIII. (1559-1625), were both enamoured of costly
bindings, the latter especially, for on the sides of his books
appears a gorgeous object representing Apollo in gold, driving
his chariot in blue or red over a silver sea.</p>

<p>Lorenzo de Medici, Prince of Florence, scholar and patron
of art and literature, called the Magnificent, who died in 1492,
stamped his books with the Medici arms, together with a laurel
branch and the motto <i>Semper</i>. Others of the Medici family
had splendid libraries, and their books were often covered with
silver and gold beautifully inlaid, after the designs of painters of
the highest eminence.</p>

<p>Amongst other Italian collectors whose fondness for calf
and morocco carried them perhaps just a little too near the
border line of extravagance, were Pietro Accolti, Cardinal of
Ancona (1445-1532), Antonio Alemanni, the poet (1500), and
Pasqual Cicogna, Doge of Venice, who died in 1595.
Specimens from the libraries of any of these, and others besides,
are sometimes worth far more than their weight in gold.</p>

<p>The Italian bookbinders were the instructors of the French,
who subsequently rivalled and finally eclipsed their masters.
At first the French merely imitated, but towards the close of
the reign of Francis I. (<i>cir.</i> 1540), they struck out fresh lines of
their own.</p>

<p>Jean Grolier is the representative collector of the early
French school, but he was, at the same time, the most famous
judge of bindings that the world has yet seen. He was born
at Lyons in 1479, and died in 1565, having spent nearly the
whole of his life in the collection of books. His opinion of
French binders appears to have been the reverse of complimentary,
for he went to Italy to find a workman after his
own heart, and one who could be relied upon to satisfy his
fastidious taste. Many people think that Grolier was by trade
a bookbinder, but this is a mistake&mdash;he was merely an enthusiastic
amateur who allowed his passion for bindings to become
his master. Some of his designs he prepared himself; others
are undoubted imitations of those adopted by Maioli, whom he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
so greatly admired, that even his motto is reproduced, with of
course the necessary variation, "Io Grolierii et Amicorum".
This appears on the sides of most of his books, and there is
consequently no difficulty in identifying them. Others bear an
emblem, and in a scroll, "&AElig;que difficulter," and others again
the words of the Psalmist arranged so as to form a triangle,
"Portio mea Domine sit in terra viventium".
<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Most of Grolier's
books were printed by Aldus at Venice, and they are generally
found lettered on the back, a practice which was not in vogue
before his day. But however bound, and whatever device,
maxim, or motto he employed, the name of Grolier invariably
causes great excitement among amateurs. The value of any of
his books is proverbial, and their scarcity equally so. A
rare book may occasionally be snapped up for a hundredth
part of its worth, not so a magnificent specimen of binding,
which courts further inquiries on the part of the vendor, and,
as we all know, "further inquiries" are usually fatal to the
would-be snapper-up of unconsidered valuables.</p>

<p>Louis de Sainte-Maure was a contemporary of Grolier, and
like him an enthusiastic book hunter. His bindings are said
to be even rarer still. They too are tooled with geometrical
figures, and on the side, in the centre, is the inscription,
"Invia virtuti nulla est via".</p>

<p>Diana of Poitiers, the mistress of Henri II. of France (<i>cir.</i>
1540), was another famous collector, who spent vast sums on
binding her books. The designs were made in all probability
by Le Petit Bernard, one of the most famous engravers of his
day, and her books, like those of Grolier, were gold tooled on
both back and sides. Diana's device consisted of a bow and a
crescent, sometimes with a sheaf of arrows. Those books
which the infatuated Henri sent to his mistress bear the H.
surmounted by a crown and flanked by the <i>fleur-de-lys</i>. Henri
was himself a collector of no mean order, and his volumes, like
those belonging to the fair Diana, have their countless worshippers.
The king, whatever the laxity of his morals, was a
stickler for etiquette, and drew a wide distinction between a
mistress and a wife. Some of his books are stamped with the
interwoven initials H. and D., and ornamented with the usual
emblems of the chase, but no crown is observable. That
makes its appearance over a solitary H., banished, so to speak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to the remoter regions of the cover. Sometimes the initials
are changed to H. C., interwoven and surmounted by the
crown, and then we know that Henri chose to honour his wife
Catherine de Medicis with notice.</p>

<p>Diana's library at the Ch&acirc;teau d'Anet was dispersed by
auction in 1723: it contained volumes of the most varied
descriptions, lives of the saints and lewd songs jostling one
another with impudent familiarity.</p>

<p>Catherine de Medicis herself had the taste of Diana for
beautiful bindings, and kept a staff of workmen, who vied with
each other in the production of beautiful specimens of ornamentation.
She had the mania of the true book collector, for
on the death of the Mar&eacute;chal de Strozzi, she laid violent hands
on his choice and valuable library, promising to pay for it
sometime, but ultimately dying herself without doing so.</p>

<p>The books of Francis I. (1515-47), if bound for his use
while Dauphin of France, are marked with a dolphin, in addition
to the ordinary kingly stamps of the Royal Arms, a salamander,
and the letter F. The motto in each case is the
same: "Nutrio et extinguo". Specimens of binding having
the dolphin are extraordinarily rare.</p>

<p>Henri III. (1574-89) did much to reduce the extravagant
cost of bookbinding, for, in 1583, he made a decree that ordinary
citizens should not decorate any single book with more
than four diamonds, or the nobility with more than five; he
himself and a few other scapegraces of the Royal House were
under no restriction. The same King instituted the order
of the "Penitents" as some little compensation for a life of
shameless vice and crime, and celebrated the occurrence by the
invention of a new binding, the originality of which is undoubted.
On black morocco, and sometimes with the Arms of France,
appear a death's head, cross-bones, tears, and other emblems of
woe, including a joke in the form of a motto, "Spes mea Deus".
Henri, when Duke of Anjou, loved Mary of Cl&egrave;ves, and subsequently
consoled himself for her untimely death by binding
a quantity of books in his library. Skulls, tears, and <i>fleurs-de-lys</i>
are thrown about in profusion; the motto, "Memento
mori," looks out at you from among floreated ornaments; Jesus
and Marie are placed on a level. When ordered to attend the
Court after the death of his beloved Mary, he made his appearance
in a black robe, embroidered all over with the usual
funereal emblems.</p>

<p>The gloomy bindings of Henri III. brought on a reaction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
giving rise to a style of decoration known as <i>&agrave; la fanfare</i>. No
sooner was the King gathered to his fathers than his sister,
Margaret of Valois, exchanged the death's heads for a fanciful
decoration, consisting of a profusion of foliage, sprinkled
with daisies. Bindings of this period are very choice, but not
so elaborate as the development of the <i>fanfare</i> eventually made
them. The foliage became much more delicate, and the
clusters of leaves and flowers at last resembled lace work,
under the magic touch of the great binder Le Gascon.</p>

<p>We now leave Royal personages, and descend to
a lower level, meeting at the very threshold the historian
Thuanus, better known as De Thou (1553-1617). This celebrated
amateur and patron of bookbinding was an intimate
friend of Grolier, and president of the Paris Parliament in the
reign of Henri IV. All his books, of which he possessed a
large number, were bound in morocco or gilded calf skin in
a style which varied with the different periods of his life. His
bachelor's library was embellished with his arms in silver, between
two branches of laurel, with his name below. After his
marriage in 1587, his wife's escutcheon is stamped alongside
his own with the initials J. A. M. below, and also on the backs
of his volumes. During his life as a widower, a wreath of
twining-stems tipped with red berries, and his own and dead
wife's initials interlaced, take the place of other ornaments.
After his second marriage in 1603, his new wife's escutcheon
appears in conjunction with his own, but the initials are
changed to J. A. G.</p>

<p>This splendid library remained intact for more than 200
years, and it was not until 1677 that it was sold almost as it
stood to the Marquis de M&eacute;nars. At his death in 1718, it was
purchased by Cardinal de Rohan, but in 1789, his heirs,
impoverished by legal proceedings, were compelled to
disperse the collection. The binders principally employed
by De Thou were the Eves (Nicholas, Clovis,
and Robert), whose splendid workmanship is a model for
such of our modern binders as follow the higher branches of
the art.</p>

<p>Le Gascon, the binder to the Duke of Orleans, who
seems to have flourished between the years 1620 and 1640, was
another workman of the first rank. The Duke was a great
collector, whose shelves were covered with green velvet, garnished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
with gold lace and fringe, and whose bindings by Le
Gascon were similarly ornamented.</p>

<p>Among the large number of French bibliophiles who now
appeared on the scene, and competed with each other in the
beauty of their bindings, one or two must necessarily be mentioned,
since the modern collector envies or admires their
taste.</p>

<p>Chancellor S&eacute;guier, at the end of the seventeenth century,
employed Ruette to make the bindings <i>au mouton d'or</i>, which
graced his shelves; and a little later still, the Baron de Longepierre
utilised the well-known ornament of the Golden Fleece,
which, when found on any book, no matter how intrinsically
worthless, greatly enhances its price. These are the prizes of
book collecting, seldom met with, and always strongly competed
for.</p>

<p>The Colberts stamped the sides of their books with their
crest, in which the climbing adder is always conspicuous.
There were no less than seven members of this family who
loved books, and all embellished them with the adder in a
shield surmounted by a crown.</p>

<p>Nicholas (1680) and Charles Louis Fouquet (1684-1761)
each adopted the coat of arms with a squirrel&mdash;looking for all
the world like a lion&mdash;and the motto, "Quo non ascendam".
Cardinal Mazarin, who died at Vincennes on the 9th of March,
1661, had many devices, the most common of which is
the coat of arms, consisting of an axe bound up in a
bundle of fasces, and surmounted by a cardinal's hat. These
and many other figures which generations of bibliophiles have
caused to be tooled on their books, point conclusively to
what library any given specimen formerly belonged, though, as
might be expected, it is sometimes a matter of great difficulty,
or even impossibility, to identify particular volumes. Some
amateurs discarded their own crests, and adopted others, for
reasons which are not apparent, while women, as, for example,
the Duchesse du Maine, who decorated her books at Sceaux
with a golden bee-hive, appear to have possessed the most
intricate armorial bearings, or to have been guided by mere
caprice, in their choice of emblems. Many books bearing
crests or coats of arms cannot, therefore, be identified, and for
this reason, amongst others, the few books which have been
written on this branch of the art of binding are necessarily
incomplete. One of the best&mdash;which, moreover, contains some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hundreds of woodcuts illustrative of various devices&mdash;is Guigard's
<i>Armorial du Bibliophile</i>, 2 vols., 8vo, Paris, 1870-3, but this is
strictly confined to French devices. Even Hobson's choice,
however, is often better than none.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Although the sixteenth century was <i>par excellence</i> the era of
ornamental bindings, it cannot be said that England made
much progress in the art. Up to the reign of Elizabeth we
seem to have persisted in the use of clumsy oak boards or stiff
parchment covers, and when a really choice and expensive
binding was required, it took the form of embroidered silks
and velvets. Queen Elizabeth herself was very expert in this
method of ornamentation, which continued to exist, in all probability,
simply because it was fashionable.</p>

<p>The first English bookbinder of any repute was John Reynes,
a printer, who lived in the reigns of Henry VII. and VIII.
Specimens of his work are very rare, though, when compared
with the French bindings of the same date, they appear miserably
inferior. The truth is that England was&mdash;and, indeed, is&mdash;much
behind some other countries in everything relating to
bibliography, and binding in particular.</p>

<p>Robert Dudley, the great Earl of Leicester, was the first
English book collector who was possessed of any degree of
taste. His cognisance of the "bear and the ragged staff"
appears on the sides of a (generally) quite plain binding,
although sometimes a rough attempt at ornamentation is
found. Archbishop Parker, and Burghley the Lord Treasurer,
had good libraries of well-bound books, and one specimen
from Bothwell's collection is known to exist. This, the
<i>Larismetique et G&eacute;ometrie</i> of La Roche, <i>Lyon</i>, 1538, was
in the possession of the late Mr. Gibson-Craig, and is
mentioned by him in his <i>Fac-similes of Old Book-Binding</i>. It
is in the original calf gilt, with gilt <i>gaufr&eacute;</i> edges, and on the sides
are the arms of James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell. Although
Bothwell is known to have possessed literary tastes, books from
his library are excessively rare. This fine book belonged
originally to the family of Forbes of Tolquhon, and a signature
and date 1588 written on the title-page show that it had been
acquired by them a few years after the outlawry and death of
the original proprietor. At the Gibson-Craig sale this fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
specimen was knocked down for &pound;81.</p>

<p>James I. was a bibliophile, as well as a reputed <i>savant</i>, and
paid much attention to the binding of his books, some of
which, now to be seen in the British Museum, are ornamented
with thistles and <i>fleurs-de-lys</i>. Lord Clarendon, who died in
1674, had a very fine collection of books, many of which were
bound by Notts, the most experienced English workman of
that day, and who was, it appears, also patronised by Pepys,
the diarist.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until the eighteenth century that we made
in this country any real advance in bookbinding. Robert Harley,
the first Earl of Oxford (1661-1724), had established a library,
and this had not only been added to by his son, but bound in
a most expensive manner, by two workmen named Elliott and
Chapman, who seem to have attained a certain amount of
proficiency, and whose efforts gave rise to a new style of ornamentation
known as the "Harleian". Though much inferior
to the Continental designs, this had a beauty of its own, and
was a vast improvement upon anything hitherto attempted by
English binders.</p>

<p>Thomas Hollis, the <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i> and antiquary, who died in
1774, bound his extensive collection in calf, adding, in each
instance, a device suitable to the contents of the work. Thus,
as the owl is the symbol of wisdom, his scientific books bear
the figure of an owl stamped on the covers. Military works
have the short Roman stabbing sword, and so on.</p>

<p>If we except, perhaps, the French emigrants who made their
home in this country at the end of the eighteenth century, there
really was no binder of any note until the advent of Roger
Payne (1739-1797). This workman, though dissolute, had,
nevertheless, a reputation in his line second to none. In
person, he is stated to have been dirty and untidy, but certainly
neither of these defects appear in his bindings, which, though
not, as a rule, heavily gilt, are tooled to neat classical or geometrical
designs after the Venetian style. Where Payne made
his mark was, perhaps, in the <i>appropriateness</i> of his bindings.
His judgment, in this respect, appears to have been sound and
popular.</p>

<p>After Payne followed Walther, Charles Hering, and Charles
Lewis, all of whom, the last particularly, did very good work.
In more recent times still we have Hayday, Rivi&egrave;re, Francis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

whose son yet carries on business in London.</p>

<p>The ordinary cloth bindings, such as we see every day in
the booksellers' shops, are purely English, and have been in
use since 1823, when they were invented by Lawson, and
adopted by Pickering, the publisher. In Continental countries
they use paper covers, and even the most expensive works are
issued originally in this form. There they bind their books
after publication if they are found to be worth binding. In
this country cloth is now largely used, and is certainly a great
improvement on the old clumsy covers of a bygone age, or on
the paper wrappers of this.</p>

<p>Bookbinding in the higher styles is now done fairly well in
England, though, in the opinion of many, the workmanship is
not equal to that of the French artists of three hundred years
ago.<br /></p>

<h3><br />BOOKS TO BUY.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE of the most difficult branches of bibliography is that
which treats of the books to choose and those to avoid, with
reference mainly to their pecuniary value. Few collectors,
who are not specialists, care very much for the utility of their
libraries; in many cases, indeed, it is not a question of utility
at all, but of extent, though I apprehend that no one would
wish to crowd his shelves with rubbish merely for the sake of
filling them. As an immense proportion of the books which
have been published during the sixteenth, seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries clearly come under that
category, the collector has much to avoid, and stands in need
of considerable experience to enable him to make a selection.</p>

<p>Naud&eacute;, the apologist for "great men suspected of magic,"
whose patron, by the way, was Cardinal Mazarin, had a
method of purchasing which, if not unique, was at any rate
uncommon. His favourite plan was to buy up entire libraries,
and sort them at his leisure; or when these were not available
in the bulk, he would, as Rossi relates, enter a shop with a yard
measure in his hand, and buy his books by the ell. Wherever
he went, paper and print became scarce: "the stalls he
encountered were like the towns through which Attila had
swept with ruin in his train". Richard Heber, the bibliotaph,
too, had collections of miscellaneous books at Paris, Antwerp,
Brussels, and other continental towns, to say nothing of London,
where the aristocracy among his treasures were deposited.
The books were sold by auction after his death; the sale
occupied 202 days, and flooded the market with rubbish&mdash;a
worthy termination to a life of sweeping and gigantic purchases,
made in the hope of acquiring single grains of wheat among
his tons of worthless chaff.</p>

<p>But Naud&eacute; had the wealth of Mazarin at his back, and free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
licence to purchase as and where he would at the Cardinal's
expense, while Heber was rich beyond the dreams of avarice;
the modern book hunter, whose means we will suppose are
limited, must discard the yard measure and the scales, and rely
on his judgment, taking care to get the utmost value for his
money. He will have to make up his mind to buy or not to
buy on the spur of the moment, for while he is consulting his
books of reference at home, a golden opportunity may be
missed. This is his capital difficulty, and one which it will
take years of experience to surmount, for there is no <i>vade
mecum</i> capable of being carried in the waistcoat pocket, which
will enable him to spot a rarity at a glance; nothing, in
fact, which can compensate for a lack of practical knowledge.
I have often thought that a register of scarce but mean-looking
English books, of such a convenient size as to be carried in the
palm of the hand, might be of assistance to those who haunt
the stalls, and delve among the rubbish usually to be found
there; some day, perhaps, it may be worth while to try the
experiment, <i>sed Gloria, quantalibet quid erit; si gloria tantum
est</i>? What will be the value of ever so much glory, if it be
glory and nothing else?</p>

<p>In turning over the contents of an old book-stall, the major
portion of the heap will be found to consist of volumes of
sermons, and other theological treatises, recipe books, odd
historical volumes, and poetical effusions, besides periodical
literature of the <i>Spectator</i> and <i>Tatler</i> brand. Books of this
class are, as a rule, merely rubbish; but still there are a few
exceptions. Sermons of John Knox and Dr. Sacheverell, or
any of Mather's tracts, are invariably worth purchasing; as also
are first editions of sermons by Cardinals Manning or Newman.
Early editions of Mrs. Glasse's cookery book, or any recipe books
of the seventeenth century, may safely be speculated in; so may
early editions of poetical works, if written by authors whose reputation
subsequently became established. Third, fourth, or later
editions are seldom of much value, no matter who the author
may be, and no matter of what character or description, provided
they come under one or other of the heads enumerated
above. In purchasing books of the class generally found on
second-hand stalls, there are two preliminary questions to be
asked: first, was the author of sufficient reputation to make his
name well known? and secondly, is the particular copy of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
works offered for sale an early edition? If an affirmative
answer can be given to each of these inquiries, it will be
advisable to tender the small sum likely to be asked, and to
run the risk.</p>

<p>Another point to be observed is that where a printer's
device appears on the title-page, or indeed on any other part of
an <i>old</i> book, it is more likely than not to have a value, and it
ought never to be passed over without a careful scrutiny.</p>

<p>Should the collector be fortunate enough to pick up a rare
French book, his best policy will be to have it suitably bound
in France by a first-rate binder. Though already valuable, its
importance will be still further increased by this man&oelig;uvre; for
when the inevitable day of parting shall arrive, the French bibliophiles
will be more inclined to welcome native talent than any
English imitation of it.</p>

<p>Volumes containing separate tracts should always be
examined, as it sometimes happens that rare pieces are found
bound up with a mass of worthless matter. I once heard of
original editions of two of Moli&egrave;re's plays being found in this
way; and as these stand pretty much in the same position, so
far as rarity and consequent value is concerned, to the early
Shakespearean quartos, the importance of the "find" to the
lucky discoverer can hardly be exaggerated. This is only
another example of the rule which can never be too often
repeated, since it can never be sufficiently understood. If the
author is "big enough," and the edition is early enough, buy.
The probability is you may not realise the full importance of
what you have got until you have had time to consult some
book of reference; it may indeed turn out that a wretched and
dirty reprint has done duty for the original, or it may so be
that the book is worthless on its merits. This is one of the
risks of book collecting, and, it may be added, one of its
charms. Hundreds of thousands of dead and forgotten books
must be annually disposed of, for nominal sums, in London
alone, and there is no telling how often these and others may
have been turned over and flung aside by passers-by before they
eventually find a market. Among all this profusion of rubbish,
a certain percentage of valuable pieces must necessarily exist,
and these, from the very circumstances under which they are
offered for sale, will be unknown, and more or less unbound
and uncut. Every year some of these princes in disguise are
rescued from the wind and rain, and henceforth considered a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
fair exchange for gold instead of copper; but alas! we cannot
both eat our cake and have it too. "Finds," as they are
called, are not so numerous as they once were, nor hucksters so
ignorant as in the merry days of Dibdin and Burton, to say
nothing of such foreign Nimrods as Colbert, Grolier, and the
great Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court.</p>

<p>The same rules which guide the haunter of the stalls are
suitable to those who purchase from the regular booksellers.
There is so much to be learned, so many artificial rules and
distinctions to be observed in everything relating to books,
that mistakes are of frequent occurrence. Ignorant assistants
have before now unwittingly thrown shabby little books, like
Burns' Poems (Kilmarnock, 1786), into the sixpenny-box at
the shop door; others have been too lazy to sort the
"parcels" as they have come in from the auctioneers, and
have bundled the whole contents into the same repository.
There are a hundred and one accidents in favour of the
book hunter, but he needs experience in order to take
advantage of them, and this cannot be got without the
expenditure of much time and money and the suffering of
many disappointments, which, indeed, seem to increase as he
grows older, rather than to diminish. This is doubtless because
the sphere of his operations becomes wider until it exceeds that
of his experience; the seventh age of the Bibliophile is even
as his first.</p>

<p>Apart from the books which are fashionable for the time
being and invariably command fancy prices, there are others
which may be styled "standards," that is to say, are sold over
and over again, both by auction and private contract, for sums
which vary only according to condition. These for the most
part are in several volumes, 8vo, frequently also in 4to or
folio. Their very appearance precludes any prospect of a
bargain; indeed the purchaser, unless well versed in book-lore,
stands a very good chance of paying for mere bulk.
When the library at Sion College took fire, the attendants at
the risk of their lives rescued a pile of books from the flames,
and it is said that the librarian wept when he found that the
porters had taken it for granted that the value of a book was
in exact proportion to its size. To this day the impression
that big books contain wisdom is all but universal. This has
always been so, as witness the temporary reputation of Nicholas
de Lyra, who wrote and printed 1800 folios of Commentary on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the Bible, and of Aldrovandus, whose thirteen large folio volumes
on General Zoology (1599-1668) have greatly perplexed the
scientific world ever since they were published. Let not the
collector be led away by massive tomes, nor imagine that
standard works of acknowledged reputation can often be got for
less than they are worth.</p>

<p>Of late years there has been a violent competition for books
and even tracts published in or in any way relating to the
American Continent provided only that they were published
during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and sometimes also the
eighteenth centuries. Thus Cotton's <i>Abstract of the Laws of
New England</i>, 1641; <i>The Description of Jamaica</i>, 1657; Brereton's
<i>Relation of the Discoverie of the North Part of Virginia</i>,
1602, and many other obscure little 4to tracts&mdash;not books&mdash;would
be cheap at twenty guineas each, while others are
worth even more. American collectors are largely responsible
for this. In the same way treatises of any kind which have
a Scotch local interest, and are dated about the same period,
are always worth two or three guineas at the least, and in many
cases far more than those amounts.</p>

<p>The earliest book printed in Scotland is <i>The Knightly
Tale of Golagrus and Gawane and other ancient poems</i> (Edinburgh,
1508), 4to, which was reprinted in fac-simile under the
superintendence of Dr. Laing in 1827. As might be expected,
the original is so scarce as to be unprocurable, and even the
reprint is of considerable value. Early Scotch-printed books
by such workmen as Walter Chepman, Androu Myllar, Andro
Hart, Alexander Arbuthnot, Thomas Davidson, Anthony
Marlar, James Watson, Andrew Anderson and his widow the
would-be monopolist, Robert Freebairn, and several others, some
of whom carried on business into the eighteenth century,
should never be overlooked or discarded. These are just the
kind of books which are occasionally discovered on stalls in
obscure streets, and which may be expected to be bought for a
few pence. They are scarce, of course, or it would not be
worth while to mention them; but they look insignificant, and
many, for anything I know, may this very day be making their
weary pilgrimage on costermongers' barrows in the New Cut,
despised and rejected of men.</p>

<p>Specimens of typography from the presses of Caxton,
Wynkyn de Worde, and other early English printers, some
of which have already been mentioned, are essentially curiosities,
and it is almost useless to hope for even the semblance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a bargain so far as they are concerned. Still, occasional finds
are from time to time reported from out-of-the-way villages
whose inhabitants have not yet wakened from their medi&aelig;val
slumbers, and great is the rejoicing of the explorer, and many
the paragraphs with which the discovery is heralded in the
newspapers. The collector who is fortunate enough to come
across a work of this class&mdash;he can hardly expect a repetition
of such extraordinary luck&mdash;will have crowned his labours, be
they great or small, and can henceforth pride himself on his
success. If he never handles a book again, he will have
earned his laurels.</p>

<p>Inferior County Histories in one volume, generally 8vo, are
always worth buying if they can be got for a few pence, as is
often the case, for there are very few of them which are not
worth as many shillings at the least. Topographical works are
now being inquired for to a much greater extent than was the
case several years ago, and the booksellers can dispose of almost
any quantity. Such examples as are likely to be casually met
with are, however, very small game; yet they represent the
average amount of success likely to be achieved at one time in
these days of widespread knowledge. The demand for book
rarities is very great, and every hole and corner, likely and
unlikely, is periodically ransacked by booksellers' "jackals," to
say nothing of the army of amateurs ever on the look-out for
bargains. Accident is, however, productive of occasional
successes, and every man has, or may have, if he thinks
proper to put it to the test, an equal chance.</p>

<p>In addition to the ready-made bargains, which do more
than anything else to delight the heart of the book lover and
encourage him to further exertions, there is such a thing as
playing upon popular likes and dislikes, or, in other words,
speculating on the vagaries of fashion. At present the rage is
for original editions of modern authors, principally those with
plates, coloured or uncoloured. Some day the fashion will
change, and books hitherto neglected will suddenly take their
place and increase many times in value. Such books should
be bought while they are cheap, and they doubtless would be
if there was such a thing as a literary barometer capable of
forecasting the state of the market; but there is not, and it is
impossible to foretell the direction in which the mass of
book lovers will turn when once they are tired of picture-books.</p>

<p>Every bookseller is of necessity a speculator, for it is his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
business to buy at a low price and to sell at a higher. The
amateur, however, should, if he would preserve his title,
abstain from traffic of this kind and be satisfied to pay for the
privilege of forming a library without regard to the ultimate
profit or loss. His pleasure should consist in acquisition and
the opportunity afforded of fondling his store while there is
time, for he may be absolutely certain that the whole assortment&mdash;bookcases,
shelves, and all&mdash;will find their way to the
auctioneer directly he has done with them. This mournful
prospect has been the indirect means of founding a new
school, that of the semi-amateurs, which, while claiming for
itself all the attributes of the book lover, has, nevertheless, an
eye to the main chance, and is prepared at a moment's notice
to transfer an entire collection <i>inter vivos</i> if the required sum
be forthcoming. As an ardent Waltonian would regard a
brother of the angle who went a-fishing with the object of
selling his catch, so the old-fashioned bibliophile views this
degenerate school&mdash;that is to say, with unfeigned disgust. It
makes no difference, nay, if anything it is an aggravation, that
the culprit is "well up" in his subject and knows a book
when he sees one. "Fancy!" says a member of the old
academy, "here is an educated man who for years has occupied
his leisure hours in studies the most delightful, and among
friends the most courteous and refined. He knows them, can
put his hand upon any in the dark, and yet&mdash;&mdash;;" but here
the power of words fails to describe the heartless greed which
alone could send a row of life's companions to the block.
Nevertheless this is being done every day, and, however
vexed the respectable book lover may be, the fact remains that
the new school is just now showing remarkable activity and is
running the booksellers very close indeed. The advisability
of purchasing depends upon the answer to a single question,
"Will this book go up?" Never mind the author, or a
syllable of what he wrote, but take especial care to see that the
work is perfect, clean, and uncut, and then ask yourself this
solitary question. This is the first and last commandment of
the semi-amateur, whose method of procedure it may be
interesting to analyse.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that a London publisher advertises a new
edition of some famous work, tastefully got up and luxuriously
bound and illustrated. The issue of course is limited, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
price is high, and discriminating purchasers must be tempted.
The old-fashioned amateur is not to be charmed because he
persuades himself that there is plenty of time, and what matter
if a few years later he has to pay a slightly enhanced price?
The book will be worth it, for it will be scarce, and, moreover,
have attained a respectable degree of antiquity, and so he
passes it by. Not so the new school, which we will assume
has answered its solitary question in the affirmative. The
edition is snapped up in a moment, and single members will
buy as many duplicates as they can afford to invest in&mdash;buy to
sell again ultimately, and in the meantime to gloat over, like
so many jackdaws eying a secreted heap of stolen goods. This
is commonly called "cornering" an edition; and when several
persons possessing the same opinions and the same tastes join
their forces, it will readily be perceived that if a book will not
go up of its own accord it may readily be forced up by judicious
retention and self-denial. This, of course, is nothing more
nor less than Stock-Exchange speculation, and it is satisfactory
to find that sometimes the greedy purchaser makes a mistake
and is saddled with a small stock of waste-paper.</p>

<p>As previously stated in the fifth chapter, a book which has
perhaps been cornered as often as any other, and never
successfully, is Ottley's <i>Italian School of Design</i>, on large
paper, with proof impressions. The published price was &pound;25
4s., the present value is about &pound;3 by auction. Here is a dreadful
falling off, and the adherents of the new school have never
yet been able to understand the reason, or to cease persuading
themselves that the day must surely come when the book will
go up. If anything, however, it is going down, and in the
opinion of many experts it can never again take a respectable
position in the market.</p>

<p>Another book which has also been speculated in, and
with even more disastrous results still, is <i>Hogarth's Works</i>,
from the original plates, restored by Heath, and published
by Baldwin and Cradock, in 1822, at &pound;50. This is a large
and sumptuous work, with a secret pocket at the end, in
which are, or should be, found the three suppressed plates.
The present auction value is not much more than &pound;4, and,
judging from appearances, it is very unlikely to get any higher.
How many people have burned their fingers over these two
tempting works it would be very difficult even to guess; suffice
it to say, that the amateur speculator often has half-a-dozen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
each on his shelves, and in nine cases out of ten he finds them
an encumbrance and a loss. As John Hill Burton truly says,
"No good comes of gentlemen amateurs buying and selling".
This is, of course, as it should be; but rejoicing at the fate of
the enemy is likely to be turned into gall when it is discovered
that defeat is bolstered up with the inevitable axiom "Better
luck next time".</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that, from a practical everyday stand-point,
the collector who buys to sell has everything in his
favour. Why should he not employ his knowledge to advantage?
why be compelled to stock his library at a loss which
will fall chiefly on his immediate descendants? why suffer the
pain and mortification of ever remembering that after all his
books are only lent to him on hire, and that as others have
parted with the identical volumes before, so he must also part
with them in his turn? The pleasure of possession is mixed
with an alloy which is disquieting to the man who loves his
books too well. Still, after all, there is one pleasure which the
votaries of the new school can never hope to enjoy, and that is
the communion with old friends. Their books are strangers,
and even though they should learn them by heart, they would
be strangers still. The remembrance of happy hours spent with
a lost volume is to them as nothing compared with the ringing
metal which replaces it; or to put the case as pleasantly
as possible, we will say that the speculator regards a book as
possessing an interest quite apart from its literary or domestic
value. How such an one would hunger after the treasures
secured by an eager collector at a fishmonger's shop in Hungerford
Market some fifty years ago&mdash;"Autograph signatures of
Godolphin, Sunderland, Ashley, Lauderdale, Ministers of
James II., accounts of the Exchequer Office signed by Henry
VII. and Henry VIII., wardrobe accounts of Queen Anne,
secret service accounts marked with the 'E. G.' of Nell
Gwynne, a treatise on the Eucharist in the boyish hand of
Edward VI., and a disquisition on the Order of the Garter, in
the scholarly writing of Elizabeth," all of which, as Mr. Rogers
Rees narrates, had been included in waste-paper cleared out of
Somerset House at &pound;7 a ton.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br /><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS most ingenious invention is designed for the rearing of all living
objects of Natural History, and is of the greatest assistance in the
scientific study (under the most favourable conditions) of the wonderful
economy and transformation of nature, and so constructed as to enable the
specimen to develop to the fullest perfection.</p>

<p><b>No. 1</b>, as illustrated, is a Ventilated Lid or Cover, with deep rim (which
fits inside of glass case, No. 2), deep enough to prevent larv&aelig; from spinning
on the glass, thus allowing the cover, with cocoons and pup&aelig; attached, to
be removed for inspection, or stored away in large cages until they emerge.</p>

<p><b>No. 2</b>, Glass Case, which permits the full power of light to freely enter
on all parts of the specimens from every point of view.</p>

<p><b>No. 3</b>, The Base (which the Case No. 2 fits into) is made to contain earth
for the growing of plants, or for the use of those insects who bury during pupa
state. The bottom of the base is perforated to allow the air to pass through
the case, thus preventing over-heating, steaming, or mildew of the specimens,
earth, or plants, which is very difficult to prevent in other forms of cases.</p>

<p><b>No. 4</b>, Is a small movable Pot to contain water in which the stems of food
plants may be placed that cannot be grown in the case, such as the cuttings
of trees, etc., which last for a considerable time in this case.</p>

<p>The Pot has a perforated india-rubber cover to prevent the larv&aelig; from
entering the water.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
